        data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">Sony PlayStation<\/a> in 1996. The game was rebuilt
        from the ground up to take advantage of the new technologies available on
        the GameCube at the time, featuring new and improved graphics, new gameplay
        elements, voice acting, script, in-game locations, and music. Shinji Mikami
        was quoted as stating that the remake is ''''70% different'''' than the original.<\/p><p>To
        account for the game''s size and quality, Resident Evil comes in 2 discs,

        Valentine doing battle against a Hunter.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Resident
        Evil plays much like every other Resident Evil game pre-Resident Evil 4, mixing
        in third-person combat, exploration, and puzzles. Though like most survival
        horror titles, Resident Evil limits the player character''s capabilities beyond
        the norm and ammunition for their firearms is generally scarce, intended to
        force players to use their supplies wisely and to choose flight rather than
        fight when possible. There are three different difficulty modes available:
        Easy, Normal, and Hard, with each one featuring tougher enemies and less ammunition
        to be found than the last.<\/p><p>Utilising the notorious ''''<a href=\"\/tank-controls\/3015-4647\"
        data-ref-id=\"3015-4647\">tank controls<\/a>'''', players move via a third
        person perspective throughout a number of pre-determined camera angles. Characters
        also cannot move and fire their weapons at the same time, and instead the
        character will ''perch'' themselves to the ground when aiming. And while the
        camera angle perspective sometimes tends to purposely obfuscate the players
        view of monsters, characters will at least (by default) aim their weapon at
        the closest enemy when players draw their gun. What is new over the original
        Resident Evil is the ability to now do an 180 degree turn, which was first
        introduced in <a href=\"\/resident-evil-3-nemesis\/3030-5587\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5587\">Resident
        Evil 3: Nemesis<\/a> and has continued as a mainstay across the series since
        then.<\/p><p>While the game follows a linear pattern of major events, the
        player is allowed to explore most of the beginning mansion at will. Many of
        the puzzles and necessary key items required to move on can be solved\/collected
        in any order.<\/p><p>The story is largely portrayed via in-game cutscenes,
        however there are also a number of Files (diaries, memos ect.) players can
        collect. These will often provide additional insight into the goings on across
        the overall narrative, but some are more vital as they will provide information
        pertaining to solving puzzles or maybe hinting as to where to go next.<\/p><h3>Playable

        Redfield<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Like the original, Resident Evil features
        two different characters--Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine--to select from.
        Each offers up a differing take on the same narrative, though what separates
        them the most is the gameplay implications, as Jill Valentine''s version of
        the game is significantly easier and more accessible than Chris''s.<\/p><p>Jill
        has more inventory space to carry items; she can potentially find an additional
        weapon exclusive only to her story, being the grenade launcher; she has with
        her a lockpick that can open locked drawers; and many more such examples.
        However Chris is somewhat sturdier than Jill and can withstand more damage
        before succumbing to death, and he also has better accuracy with handguns
        giving players the increased chance to pop a zombie''s head completely just
        with one shot.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8497\/236033-character_select1.jpg\"

        supporting character that they will often encounter and interact with during
        the game. Jill Valentine has with her fellow STARS Alpha team member Barry
        Burton, whereas Chris has the rookie medic of STARS Bravo team, Rebecca Chambers.
        Both Barry and Rebecca will sometimes have to help the player character from
        a perilous situation, though Barry will always be an NPC. During Chris'' story,
        however, players may take control of Rebecca Chambers on two separate occasions
        to help save Chris from dying of poison, and to kill the mutated plant monster
        Plant 42.<\/p><h3>Inventory<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\"

        Redfield''s 6-slot inventory screen<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Depending on
        which character the player chooses, they will either have six (Chris) or eight
        (Jill) inventory slots in total. Each type of item requires only one slot,
        however. Each character also one additional slot strictly to house a unique
        item; Chris possesses a lighter, and Jill has a lockpick. Besides the character''s
        inventory, there also exist a number of <a href=\"\/item-box\/3055-6126\"
        data-ref-id=\"3055-6126\">item boxes<\/a> where players can store unwanted
        items. Item boxes are often located within save rooms (though not always)
        and items will persist throughout all item boxes across the game.<\/p><p>All
        items and weapons can be examined by the player, allowing them to get a closer
        look and turn the object around. This can sometimes change the properties
        of certain key items, such as unlocking\/opening a key item to reveal another
        inside, or may at least change the title to reflect the item''s true identity.<\/p><h3>Self-Defense
        Items<\/h3><p>One notable feature exclusive to the remake is the addition
        of self-defense items. Given a separate inventory slot, there are three different
        self-defense items that players may find and then equip. Once one is equipped,
        from that point when a player is grabbed by an enemy, the player can then
        press the firing button which will then show the character using the self-defense
        item to escape the grab, canceling out any possible damage inflicted upon
        the character. All self-defense items are one use only, however.<\/p><p>There
        are three different self-defense items, one of which can be found by both
        characters, and one unique item for each:<\/p><ul><li><b>Daggers<\/b> - Can
        be found during both Chris and Jill''s and will inflict moderate damage unto
        an enemy. There''s a small chance that when the enemy has been shot, the dagger
        will fall onto the ground and can be collected once again by the player.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Flashbang<\/b>
        - Chris'' exclusive self-defense item, Chris will shove the flashbang into
        the attacking enemy''s mouth and, once shot by the player, will explode killing
        the creature completely.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Taser<\/b> - Jill''s exclusive
        self-defense item, Jill will pull out the taser and then zap the enemy doing
        a high amount of damage. It will kill a zombie outright, though sturdier enemies
        such as hunters can sometimes manage to survive the current.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Health
        &amp; Herbs\/First Aid Sprays<\/h3><p>A character''s health can be seen via
        the inventory menu, with an Electrocardiograph Machine showing a character''s
        status. The different statuses are:<\/p><ul><li><strong>Fine<\/strong> - The
        character is in good health.<\/li><li><strong>Caution<\/strong> - The character
        is roughly at half health.<\/li><li><strong>Danger<\/strong> - The character
        is approaching death.<\/li><li><strong>Poison<\/strong> - The character is
        poisoned and their health will slowly deplete.<\/li><\/ul><p>Besides the EKG,
        players may also note the character''s stance. Whence the characters starts
        holding onto their hip, that is a sign that their health is at least in the
        Caution state, or may even be poisoned.<\/p><p>Carrying the tradition set
        by the original Resident Evil, characters use a small variety of <a href=\"\/medical-herb\/3055-566\"
        data-ref-id=\"3055-566\">herb<\/a>s to heal themselves and cure poisons. <a
        href=\"\/first-aid-spray\/3055-619\" data-ref-id=\"3055-619\">First Aid Spray<\/a>s
        are also available, though they only have the singular purpose of healing
        the character fully. There exist three herb types, all of which can be combined
        in some way for different degrees of healing:<\/p><ul><li><b>Green Herb<\/b>
        - On its own will restore 25% of health.<\/li><li><b>Blue Herb<\/b> - On its
        own will cure poison, though will not restore any health.<\/li><li><b>Red
        Herb<\/b> - On its own does nothing.<\/li><li><b>Green + Green Herb<\/b> -
        Mixed will heal the character by roughly 50% of health.<\/li><li><b>Green
        + Green + Green Herb<\/b> - Mixed will heal the character completely, though
        not of any poisons.<\/li><li><b>Green + Blue Herb<\/b> - Mixed will heal the
        character 25% of health and cure any poison.<\/li><li><b>Green + Green + Blue
        Herb<\/b> - Mixed will heal the character 50% of health and cure any poison.<\/li><li><b>Green
        + Red Herb<\/b> - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of
        any poisons.<\/li><li><b>Green + Red + Blue Herb<\/b> - Mixed will heal the
        character completely including poisons.<\/li><li><b>Red + Blue Herb<\/b> -
        Mixed will do nothing.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Saving<\/h3><p>Like every other main
        Resident Evil game pre-Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil requires that players
        find one of the many typewriters located throughout the environments to save,
        and must also have at least one ink ribbon item in their character''s inventory.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><h3>Main

        playable main characters of Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine, the story largely
        follows the same path. The primary difference between the two is which characters
        are featured and what their role is. For Chris Redfield''s story, he works
        alongside Rebecca Chambers amidst their attempts to survive the Mansion, whereas
        Jill Valentine has Barry Burton as her supporting character. However, both
        Rebecca and Barry do not appear in the other character''s campaigns; Barry
        will at least still show up in the opening cutscene during Chris''s story,
        but then disappears completely and isn''t encountered again. And Rebecca Chambers
        is omitted from Jill Valentine''s story completely.<\/p><p>Whichever of the
        two main characters the player selects, the other is then also absent from
        the majority of the game until the very end. The canon telling of the game''s
        story is made up of varying factors of both interpretations, however, including
        the involvement of both Rebecca Chambers and Barry Burton.<\/p><h3>Plot<\/h3><figure

        in a nearby mansion, though the mansion proves to be just as dangerous as
        the outside forest.<\/p><p>As they explore throughout the mansion, the team
        uncover more and more grisly remains of what''s left of the Bravo team. Team
        medic Rebecca Chambers is the only one who is found to be in good health.
        As S.T.A.R.S. travel throughout more of the mansion, and the nearby residence
        building, they soon learn that this mansion is owned by one Ozwell E. Spencer,
        the head of the pharmaceutical company Umbrella. Deep below the mansion courtyard
        is an Umbrella laboratory which was used to create the T-Virus. The T-Virus
        in turn is what lead to the mansion being infested with an all manner of creatures
        including zombies, which were once Umbrella researchers, after an outbreak.<\/p><figure

        &amp; Chris doing battle against Tyrant<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>As the team
        investigate further, it is also revealed that S.T.A.R.S. captain Albert Wesker
        was in fact initially working for Umbrella as a scientist. Though he has now
        decided to move on from Umbrella to continue his own nefarious ambitions,
        and only brought in his own S.T.A.R.S. team so as to collect combat data;
        he was also blackmailing Barry Burton by way of his family so as to lead the
        other S.T.A.R.S. members astray, though Barry will eventually break free of
        Wesker''s hold and save his compatriots. Wesker himself is seemingly killed
        by his own creation the T-002 Tyrant--a hulking monster with a large, imposing
        claw--after he releases it to kill the remaining S.T.A.R.S. members. The team
        are then able to successfully kill the creature, place a bomb in the laboratory,
        and escape the resulting explosion via helicopter piloted by Brad Vickers,
        who had abandoned the team during the beginning in the forest once the undead
        dogs shown up.<\/p><h3>Alternate Endings<\/h3><p>Not only depending on which
        main character the player chooses, the endings of the game can also be determined
        by specific choices made throughout the game based on which characters manage
        to survive.<\/p><p>During Chris''s story once the player returns to the Mansion
        after exploring the Residential building, Rebecca is forced into an encounter
        with a Hunter and screams for help; if the player can''t reach her quick enough,
        she will die. If she survives, then Rebecca will able to set the bomb to destroy
        the mansion, triggering the resurgence of Tyrant on the Helipad. It''ll slowly
        advance towards Rebecca and if the player isn''t able to pull his attention
        away from her, it''ll kill her instantly. Jill Valentine can also be left
        behind (and potentially killed for certain if Rebecca is still alive by that
        point) if the player isn''t able to find the three MO discs required to unlock
        the door to her cell, and vice versa when playing as Jill herself.<\/p><p>During
        Jill''s story amidst the Lisa Trevor boss battle, Barry Burton pulls his gun
        on Jill with what is insinuated to be the intent to kill her. During his hesitation,
        Jill swiftly pulls the gun from him and directs it back at him. However as
        Lisa Trevor closes in, Barry pleads that Jill hands him his gun. From here
        the player has the choice of giving it to him or not; if not, Barry will be
        killed. If so, then he will fight alongside Jill against Lisa. Though Barry
        may still be killed during this fight if Lisa gets close enough to knock him
        off into the chasm below.<\/p><p>If Barry survives the encounter, which sets
        in the motion the outcome of Wesker escaping and setting the Mansion to self-destruct,
        this triggers the ambush by Tyrant on the Helipad. It''ll then slowly advance
        towards Barry and if the player isn''t able to pull his attention from him,
        it''ll kill Barry instantly.<\/p><p>Overall there are technically eight endings
        in total dependant on which combination of characters managed to survive the
        Mansion Incident, which also affects other such outcomes including whether
        or not the Mansion is destroyed.<\/p><p><b>Chris'' Story<\/b>:<\/p><ol><li>Chris,
        Rebecca, and Jill survive; Albert Wesker is killed; the Spencer Mansion is

        killed; the Spencer Mansion is left as it is along with Tyrant.<\/li><\/ol><p>The
        canon ending of Resident Evil is again made up of varying factors across both
        stories, including the survival of Chris, Jill, Barry, and Rebecca, the destruction
        of the Mansion, Wesker''s supposed ''death, and the hatred Wesker grows for
        Chris.<\/p><h2>Weapons<\/h2><h3>Survival Knife<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\"

        attained during Jill Valentine''s story, and even then only if the player
        decides against giving Barry his gun back during the Lisa Trevor boss battle.
        However, the magnum ammo players find throughout the mansion isn''t compatible
        with the Anaconda and as such becomes useless once all of its six rounds are
        used up.<\/p><h3>Self-Defense Gun<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\"

        as reliable as ever, the remake''s shotgun has a strong kick and plenty of
        power, making it a fine choice for just about any enemy across the game. It
        can kill a zombie outright with just a single shot when aimed at the head,
        and it can even keep Hunters at bay as well. When facing against certain boss
        battles, like Plant 42, the character will be shown to aim down the barrel
        whereas they usually aim from the hip.<\/p><p>Acquiring the shotgun can differ
        slightly between Chris and Jill. Because collecting the shotgun will instigate
        the ceiling trap, Chris therefore requires the Broken Shotgun item to trade
        in its place. However Jill may potentially be able to collect it without the
        need for the Broken Shotgun.<\/p><p>Should Jill collect the shotgun, Barry
        will then arrive to save her from the trap. Though only if the player didn''t
        meet Barry prior when finding the corpse of Forest Speyer, otherwise Jill
        will then require the Broken Shotgun item as well.<\/p><h3>Assault Shotgun<\/h3><figure

        staple of the older Resident Evil games, zombies are of course as prominent
        as ever in the Resident Evil remake. Slow and sluggish in movement, but dangerous
        up close, zombies are durable enough against gunfire that they can prove to
        be extremely dangerous even just in small numbers. When encountered on their
        own, however, zombies can be dispatched relatively easy so long as the player
        has enough ammunition to spare. As per usual, zombies are best dealt with
        the pistol or sometimes the shotgun, which can kill a zombie with a single
        shot if the player aims directly at its head once close enough, or can at
        least reduce the zombie to a literal crawl by destroying its legs.<\/p><p>Zombies
        attack by grabbing and biting the player when close, but will also puke out
        acid instead if they can''t quite reach the player. Some zombies will be encountered
        lying on the ground, seemingly pretending to be dead, and will grab at a character''s
        leg should the player get close enough. However, the leg bite does little
        damage and will always result in the character killing the zombie with a single
        stomp or kick.<\/p><p>When encountered on stairs zombies are much less of
        a threat, as they won''t attempt to bite the player and will simply rely on
        their acid vomit making them significantly easier to rush past.<\/p><h3>Crimson

        zombie has been ''''killed''''. The only way to halt the transformation is
        for players to burn the corpse afterwards (or kill a zombie by destroying
        the head) using a lighter and some gas fluid, both of which must be in the
        player''s inventory for use. Otherwise after an allotted time, once returning
        to an area the now Crimson Head zombie will quickly spring into action and
        will forever persist in that area until it has been killed.<\/p><p>While Crimson
        Heads will place priority in hunting the player character down, they are known

        regular zombies, some sort of iteration surrounding infected dogs have persisted
        across nearly every Resident Evil game to date. Starting at the beginning,
        so to speak, the Cerberus Dogs of Resident Evil are infected Doberman breeds,
        purposely engineered to be a form of B.O.W. Cerberus dogs retain the same
        agility and tenacity as a regular dog, though with a massive increase in aggressiveness,
        brutality, and stamina.<\/p><p>Like zombies, Cerberus dogs are best left for
        lesser weaponry like the pistols and shotguns. Running past is always an option
        as well, as both Chris and Jill are just ever so slightly faster than the
        canines. However their attacks can sometimes cover just enough distance to
        close the gap and catch the player character.<\/p><h3>Web Spinners<\/h3><figure

        hairy spiders, the Web Spinners are a tenacious foe across Resident Evil,
        though they primarily appear only briefly within the Residential building.
        They can crawl along walls like any other spider, and will often try to charge
        forward and bite players when given the opportunity. However, their greatest
        weapon is their poison spit, which they will routinely spray; it has a fairly
        long reach of attack and has a high chance of poisoning the player, though
        the base damage it inflicts isn''t quite as alarming. Before they fire their
        spit, they can first be heard to be readying it within their body.<\/p><p>Web
        Spinners have surprisingly tough hides and are most susceptible to the Grenade
        Launcher - specifically when equipped with flame rounds. They will also often
        strafe once they''ve been shot and attempt to counter the player as such.
        If a Web Spinner is killed with its sack intact, a large multitude of baby
        spiders will seep out of the corpse and attack the player. Though their damage
        is even less than that of a crow and should the player leave the area, they
        will return to find them all gone.<\/p><h3>Hunters<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\"

        appearing once players return to the Mansion after investigating the Residential
        building, Hunters will then replace the common zombies of the game and will
        be encountered throughout in most areas where the zombies originally populated.
        Hunters are extremely dangerous and one of the most antagonising enemies throughout
        the franchise, let alone Resident Evil. They attack using their sharp claws
        and their most common source of attack is to leap through the air and slash
        the player. Though the player can still manage to shoot the Hunter mid-jump
        if they react fast enough.<\/p><p>Should the character''s health be in the
        Caution state or lower, however, the Hunter''s dive will be replaced with
        a swift cleave which will decapitate the character killing them instantly.
        Though they will at least let out a distinctive shriek first to notify players
        they are preparing such an attack. Hunters take one, sometimes two, shots
        from the Colt Python, which makes for the most suitable weapon. Otherwise
        the grenade launcher, and even the shotgun, can do the job if there''s enough
        distance between the Hunter and the player. However Hunters are almost always
        encountered in groups of at least two.<\/p><h3>Chimera<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\"

        only within the secret underground laboratory, Chimeras are wretched creatures
        made up of both human and fly DNA. Like Hunters, these too were artificially
        created by Umbrella themselves, though they apparently proved to be unreliable
        and not as effective as the Hunter B.O.W. They primarily function like a cross
        between Web Spinners and Hunters; Chimera''s can scuttle across flat surfaces,
        and will usually try to slash the player from above, but will also land into
        the floor and give chase. From this stage, Chimera''s may possibly leap onto
        the character''s back and slice them from there.<\/p><p>They can be relatively
        easy to avoid, however--especially if they''ve following whilst on the ceiling--and
        typically take around 2-3 shotgun rounds should direct combat come to pass.
        Though much like the Hunters, Chimera are rarely encountered alone and they
        will sometimes attempt to swarm the player as a pairing by attacking from
        two different directions.<\/p><h3>Adders<\/h3><p>Highly aggressive poisonous
        snakes, Adders can be found throughout the Mansion garden and will drop from

        number of them at that. Running past them is the best option, however due
        to their size they can be difficult to distinguish. If the player decides
        on combat they will at least die by but a single handgun shot.<\/p><h3>Wasps<\/h3><p>Found
        in the Residential building, a sizeable wasp cocoon has formed within. Though
        the wasps themselves do very little damage and die with at most 2 shots from
        a handgun, they will continually respawn until the player can find the item
        required to put an end to the wasp cocoon.<\/p><h2>Boss Battles<\/h2><h3>Crimson

        managed to restrain it and locked it underground in a tomb. Once released
        by the player, it soon awakens and begins chase just as the gate is closed
        behind to stop the player from escaping. The Prototype functions much like
        an ordinary Crimson Head zombie; it''ll run at the player and attempt to swipe
        with their claws, however it will always use its right claw, allowing the
        player to avoid its attack if they run to the left. It will continue this
        routine until it dies, which only requires around 4-5 shotgun shells on the
        Normal difficulty.<\/p><h3>Yawn Part I<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10354\/2357191-pachislot_yawn.png\"

        monstrously huge snake that resides within an attic, Yawn will surface once
        the player enters in search of a crest. This battle is completely voluntary,
        however, as the player can attempt to just collect the crest and escape. Because
        of the snake''s size, this can sometimes prove difficult. If the player is
        bitten there''s a high that they''ll be poisoned. If the player''s poisoned,
        the character will pass out once they escape the room.<\/p><p>As Jill, she
        will pass out and fall to the ground, with Barry arriving soon after who will
        take her to the first floor save room. This is all done instantaneously amidst
        a black screen, however, and Jill will wake up to find Barry gone. As Chris,
        he too will pass out just as he leaves the area and will be greeted by Rebecca
        Chambers. However in this occurrence, the player takes control of Rebecca
        and must collect the serum from the first floor medicinal save room for Chris
        within 7 minutes, otherwise he will die and the game will be over. Fighting
        Yawn can be tricky because of its size and its stamina; it will generally
        require around 10 shotgun shots or 4-5 grenade launcher rounds on the Normal
        difficulty to force it to flee.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10354\/2400172-yawnuc.jpg\"

        to note is during Jill''s playthrough, and if the player manages to save Richard
        Aiken from his poison infection, once the player goes to fight Yawn Richard
        will join soon after equipped with his custom Assault Shotgun. From there
        he will assist the player if they choose to attack Yawn; after so much damage,
        Yawn will recede away, but will strike again once Jill and Richard lower their
        guard and will swallow Richard whole. If the player instead chooses to ignore
        Yawn and collect the crest and leave, Richard will scream after no doubt suffering
        the same fate. If players fight alongside Richard until his inevitable death,
        they will then be able to collect his assault shotgun - the cutscene of Richard
        pushing Jill out of the way depicts him dropping his shotgun at the last second.
        However should players abandon Richard, then the shotgun is presumably gobbled
        up by Yawn alongside Richard and cannot be collected<\/p><h3>Yawn Part II<\/h3><figure

        in the library, Yawn will resurface after the player while they''re looking
        for a specific book. Yawn functions exactly like it did in the previous battle
        and will slither throughout the environment in its attempts to bite and poison
        the player. Unlike the first encounter, this battle is mandatory as finally
        killing Yawn is the only way to trigger it knocking the bookcase and revealing
        a book the player needs.<\/p><p>If the player is poisoned this time they are
        left to carry on without any assist. Though by this point blue herbs to cure
        the poison are now accessible and can be found throughout the mansion. Any

        Trevor is a new character and boss specifically created for the remake. She
        is a young teen girl, but one that underwent extensive testing and experimentation
        with a number of viruses turning her into a hunchbacked monster. Lisa was
        actually the precursor for the Nemesis project seen in <a href=\"\/resident-evil-3-nemesis\/3030-5587\"
        data-ref-id=\"3030-5587\">Resident Evil 3,<\/a> though unlike Nemesis, Lisa
        cannot be controlled.<\/p><p>The first time Lisa is encountered is when the
        player enters the nearby cabin in the woods and is ambushed by Lisa knocking
        the player character out. Once the character comes to, they quickly take notice
        of Lisa Trevor as she slowly limps toward the player. Lisa is invincible and
        can only be temporarily warded for a couple of seconds; this can help the
        player escape the cabin, which at this point in time is the only option the
        player has. Lisa''s attacks can do a great deal of damage at that and can
        kill both Chris or Jill in just 3 hits on the Normal difficulty.<\/p><h3>Lisa
        Trevor Part II<\/h3><p>Encountered within the Caves\/Mines underneath the
        Mansion, Lisa Trevor functions as she did before and cannot be killed. Once
        again the player is to avoid all encounters with Lisa, though this time the
        player must also attempt to pull a couple of levers necessary to continue
        on. Like before, the player can attack Lisa enough that she may very briefly
        become incapacitated to allow the player past. The area is filled with a series
        of narrow pathways, however, which can make trying to run past Lisa head on
        practically impossible. Though there are multiple passageways that offer opportunities
        for the player to skirt Lisa and work their way around her.<\/p><h3>Lisa Trevor

        final encounter with Lisa, Chris\/Jill will arrive in a cavern and will be
        greeted by Albert Wesker as Chris and Barry Burton as Jill. As Chris, Wesker
        greets Chris and asks him to ''''get a piece of the action''''. During this
        battle, Wesker will attempt to help Chris in warding Lisa off.<\/p><p>There
        are two ways to beat this battle. Because the area is made of a small square
        platform surrounded on its left and right side by what looks like a endless
        pit, the player can potentially do enough damage to force Lisa off the edge,
        though this requires a fair amount of damage inflicted unto Lisa. Otherwise
        the player can attempt to manoeuvre around the area pushing the stones off
        of the surface; once all four have been pushed off, this will open the coffin
        in the middle that contains the remains of Lisa''s mother. The sight of her
        mother will drive Lisa to temporarily express the one small piece of humanity
        she has left as she cries in vain at her mother and leaps off into the abyss
        with a shriek.<\/p><p>With Jill this battle plays out the same, though the
        opening will offer the player a choice to hand Barry his custom magnum after
        handily taking it off him after he threateningly directed it at Jill. If the
        player chooses Yes, then Barry will fight alongside Jill; if No, then Lisa
        will knock Barry off killing him, forcing Jill to fight alone but also letting
        her keep Barry''s fully loaded magnum revolver.<\/p><p>When fighting against
        Lisa she uses the same array of attacks. Though the tactic for knocking her
        off works both ways as she too can not only knock the player off, but also
        their AI ally. If Barry is knocked off he is then declared dead for the ending.
        However, if Wesker is knocked off he will still appear during the end as per
        usual. Wesker surviving the drop is never brought up nor explained later in
        the game.<\/p><h3>Neptune<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10354\/2400182-re_neptune.jpg\"

        even more aggressive breed of shark, Neptune is a great white infected with
        the T-Virus and is the most unconventional boss battle in the game as the
        player doesn''t actually fight it. Once entering the aqua tank, the player
        will be enveloped in knee high water which will slow their character''s movement
        speed. The player is to quickly run across the walkway into the control room
        before Neptune leaps out and attacks; the music will quickly rise in tempo
        and urgency to let the player know how close Neptune is to attacking. It''s
        possible to avoid Neptune, but if it is in reach of the player it will quickly
        pull the player into the water killing them instantly.<\/p><p>Once the player
        has reached the control room, and has climbed down the ladder, they''ll now
        be underwater, faced by Neptune on the opposite side of the window. Neptune
        will then attempt to break the glass, forcing the player to configure the
        settings in the control room to close the shutters over the window before
        Neptune smashes through the glass. Once that''s done, and the water has been
        drained, the player will leave the room leading into the ground floor of the
        tank. Along the way the player will encounter two lesser infected sharks which
        are barely clinging to life within the oxygen. The player may choose to mercy
        kill them, though it''s not necessary.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10354\/2400184-full.jpg\"

        water. It is completely docile for the time being, but once the player tries
        to grab a key they require on a platform past Neptune, it will spring into
        action and attempt to attack the player. Neptune cannot move, but the player
        is trapped on the small raised platform. Pushing the circuit box into the
        water and turning on the power will then kill Neptune completely, allowing
        the player to move past safely.<\/p><p>As Jill the scenario plays out as such,
        though when playing as Chris, and if Richard was cured of the snake poison
        inflicted by Yawn, Chris will encounter Richard as he first enters the tank.
        Richard will then quickly push Chris out of the way -- saving him from Neptune''s
        attack, but dying in his place. Once the player has drained the tank, they
        can collect Richard''s custom shotgun on the tank''s ground floor.<\/p><h3>Plant

        Dubbed Plant 42 for being located within ''''Point 42'''', the carnivorous
        plant has entrenched itself within the Residential Building and uses its vines
        to attack its prey throughout the building via small holes in the floors,
        walls and ceiling. If the player nears any of these holes, the plant''s vine
        will attack and attempt to strangle the player until they waggle it off by
        mashing on the buttons. Once the body of the Plant has been located, this
        initiates the boss battle. Large in size, reaching the ceiling at around 12ft
        in height, it primarily attacks by using its vines to squirt small droplets
        of acid, though it will also attempt to attack the player by swiping them
        with its vines as well.<\/p><p>The best strategy is for the player to climb
        up the stairs reaching what remains of the second floor and shoot at the bulb.
        After enough damage, it will recede only to quickly sprout back out. As Jill,

        gigantic tarantula, even by the giant spider standards of the game, the appropriately
        coined Black Tiger is colored in shades of black and grey. It functions like
        its smaller kin of spiders, though its poison spit is more ferocious and will
        actually shoot three splashes at once with a greater range. The environment
        is relatively small, which allows the player to run around the creature to
        keep out of its poison distance. The shotgun, grenade launcher and magnum
        work as expected, though Black Tiger is especially weak to flame rounds shot
        from the grenade launcher. As Chris, the player will have a flamethrower available
        which is also effective. Alongside Black Tiger are two regular Web Spinners
        as well that have the same attributes as previously encountered Web Spinners<\/p><p>Once
        killed, a multitude of small spiders will begin to seep out of its corpse,

        Wesker''s betrayal is revealed, he (or Barry accidentally) will release Tyrant,
        where it will proceed to slowly walk towards the player. The battle itself
        is relatively simple as it will only walk towards the player, though it won''t
        flinch against any gunfire. Keeping Tyrant at a safe distance, while circling
        the large lab equipment, the player should be able to down the monster without
        taking any damage so long as they have enough ammo. Tyrant is unsurprisingly
        thick skinned and requires a fair amount of ammunition; the magnum alone will
        still take around 8 rounds to put down on the Normal difficulty.<\/p><h3>Tyrant
        T-002 Part II<\/h3><p>The final battle of the game, this second encounter
        with Tyrant is only triggered should the player have Barry or Rebecca alive,
        otherwise this battle will be skipped altogether and Brad Vickers will arrive
        to pick up the remaining characters.<\/p><p>Otherwise it will erupt from the
        ground on the heliport and its gameplay design will have now changed drastically.
        No longer content in steadily walking towards the player, Tyrant will now
        routinely break into a quick sprint and swipe with its massive claw at the
        player dealing a great deal of damage. With Barry or Rebecca at their side,
        the player at least has some backup. Though they too can be killed by Tyrant
        and must also reload when necessary. After Tyrant has received enough damage,
        or the timer that is ticking down has reached around 30 seconds, Brad Vickers
        will drop down a rocket launcher the player must use to kill Tyrant.<\/p><p>Equipped
        with only four shots, the Tyrant will manage to deflect the first, though
        the second will score a direct hit destroying the Tyrant completely.<\/p><h2>Unlockables<\/h2><p>Resident

        and some of its own original inclusions.<\/p><h3>Costumes<\/h3><p>Getting
        the Happy ending (with all three characters surviving the Mansion Incident)

        large painting in the first room to the right from the hall--which has two

        S.T.A.R.S. custom pistol, the Samurai Edge has infinite ammo and a much faster
        rate of fire. Because of its higher fire rate, the Samurai Edge can prove
        useful not only against regular zombies, but even larger enemies like Hunters
        and certain bosses given its infinite quantity of ammunition. The Samurai
        Edge is unlocked by completing the game once under five hours on the Normal
        or Hard difficulty setting, and can be found in the character''s inventory
        when loading a cleared game save.<\/p><h3><b>Rocket Launcher<\/b><\/h3><p>Unlocked
        by completing the game on Normal or Hard under 3 hours. Found in the player''s
        inventory upon loading their completed save file, the rocket launcher can
        kill everything (besides the Tyrant on the helipad) in one shot.<\/p><h3>One

        by completing the game on any difficulty in any time, this mode is then weaved
        into any following playthroughs. The game will play out as usual, however
        the zombified Forest Speyer will sporadically appear in certain areas and
        will give chase. Forest will function like an ordinary zombie and will try
        to grab and bite the player, though he runs at the speed of a Crimson Head.
        The player cannot attack Forest in any way, either, as he has a bandoleer
        of grenades strapped around his torso and any attacks will cause him to explode
        -- killing the player instantly regardless of the distance.<\/p><p>Because
        Forest is travelling around the mansion and has already reanimated, he will
        of course not be found in the outside balcony as per usual. Forest will also
        only be encountered within the Spencer Mansion and will not follow into the
        other environments across the game. There is no way to turn off this mode
        and the player must start a new save to play without the stalking of Speyer.<\/p><h3>Invisible
        Enemy Mode<\/h3><p>Unlocked by completing on any difficulty in any time, the
        Invisible Enemy Mode is as self-explanatory as they get -- all of the enemies
        within the game, bosses included, are invisible to the player. There is no
        longer any auto aim at that, though they will make their typical sound effects
        once the player is in the location. The player''s unlockable weapons\/costumes
        will not carry over into this mode.<\/p><h3>Real Survivor Mode<\/h3><p>Unlocked
        by completing on any difficulty in any time, Real Survivor mode was initially
        a prototype mode for the original Resident Evil. Its notary difference is
        that the item boxes no longer share items and any items stored in one particular
        box will forever stay exclusively in that one box. Auto aim is also disabled
        and the gameplay modifiers are set within the Hard mode settings.<\/p><h2>HD

        on August 5th, 2014 was an HD port version of the Resident Evil remake for
        PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and PC. Its pre-rendered backgrounds are to
        be upscaled (720p on PS3 and Xbox 360; 1080p on PS4 and Xbox One), though
        certain objects and even whole areas were redone completely in polygons.<\/p><p>Character
        models are redone in HD, and it also allows players to select between 4:3
        or 16:9 aspect ratio. However when playing in 16:9 the screen will crop the
        image and then pan up\/down depending on the direction the character moves.<\/p><p>While
        the game still offers the classic tank control scheme, more modernized analogue
        controls are also be available as an alternative -- to which the player can
        switch between in real-time. A Very Easy mode was included as well to further
        increase its accessibility for a more modern audience. The Remastered port
        was released in both physical and digital formats, however its physical format
        is restricted to its PS3 and 360 versions, and only in Japan.<\/p><p>Online
        Leaderboards are available in this version, as is a new Gallery mode that
        lets players re-watch the game''s pre-rendered cutscenes.<\/p><p>The port
        was rather successful and proved to be Capcom''s top selling digital release
        of all time, selling over a million copies. This success resulted in the team
        moving on to have <a href=\"\/resident-evil-zero\/3030-10247\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10247\">Resident

        form of viral marketing for the HD Remaster port, the Contagion Campaign allowed
        Resident Evil fans to ''''spread the infection'''' by signing up via email,
        facebook, or <a href=\"\/resident-evilnet\/3015-7553\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7553\">ResidentEvil.net<\/a>.
        Upon doing so would add to the overall infection percentage shown on the site;
        sharing the user''s status on such social media sites as facebook or twitter
        would also help further the infection.<\/p><p>Capcom later announced that
        should the infection reach 100%, they would include Chris and Jill''s BSAA
        outfits from <a href=\"\/resident-evil-5\/3030-20569\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20569\">Resident
        Evil 5<\/a> in the game, though Chris''s his Lost in Nightmares outfit as
        opposed to his default RE5 attire.<\/p><p>On September 26th, the ''''infection''''
        officially reached 100%, assuring that the new costumes were to appear in
        the HD Remastered port. The costumes are unlocked at the outset and can be
        selected within the character select menu, which is also now how the other
        unlockable costumes of the game are to be selected as well.<\/p><h2>Development<\/h2><p>To
        better connect this game with narrative advancements of later games, Resident
        Evil spliced in some additional story details that were absent from the original.
        One of the more noticeable ones is the addition of <a href=\"\/george-trevor\/3005-11814\"
        data-ref-id=\"3005-11814\">George<\/a> and <a href=\"\/lisa-trevor\/3005-6121\"
        data-ref-id=\"3005-6121\">Lisa Trevor<\/a>. George designed the Arklay Mansion
        which ultimately ended up being his grave and his daughter Lisa was the subject
        of Umbrella''s hideous experiments and will be encountered by the player at
        various times through the game. These additions were scrapped from the original
        game but have been added in to give the Resident Evil mythos some more depth.
        Other such additions include the mention of <a href=\"\/william-birkin\/3005-3332\"
        data-ref-id=\"3005-3332\">William Birkin<\/a> and <a href=\"\/alexia-ashford\/3005-4456\"
        data-ref-id=\"3005-4456\">Alexia Ashford<\/a>.<\/p><p>There were also several
        new locations created for the remake such as the Graveyard behind the secret
        door in the main hall and Lisa''s Cabin in the Courtyard. These extra locations
        gave the game new puzzles that the player would find a new challenge even
        if they played and completed the original. Even puzzles that were ported over
        from the original were remixed, as were enemy placements and the general design
        of the mansion was reworked in places so as to give the mansion the feeling
        of nostalgia, yet with plenty of surprises for veterans of the series.<\/p><h2>PC

        data-ref-id=\"3010-367\">Capcom<\/a> on January 19th, 2012 and released at
        October 2nd, 2012. Set in 2013, four years after <a href=\"\/resident-evil-5\/3030-20569\"
        data-ref-id=\"3030-20569\">Resident Evil 5<\/a> (and 10 years since the downfall
        of <a href=\"\/umbrella-corporation\/3015-204\" data-ref-id=\"3015-204\">Umbrella<\/a>),
        Resident Evil 6 brings back the two most prominent leads <a href=\"\/chris-redfield\/3005-413\"

        data-ref-id=\"3005-649\">Leon S. Kennedy<\/a> to canonically star together
        for the first time in Resident Evil history.<\/p><p>Shying away from a linear
        progression like the most recent Resident Evil titles, Resident Evil 6 allows
        players to select from any of the four available campaign stories--Leon, Chris,
        <a href=\"\/ada-wong\/3005-1106\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1106\">Ada<\/a>, and

        Muller<\/a>--in whichever order they so choose, somewhat reminiscent of the

        by RE6 director <a href=\"\/eiichiro-sasaki\/3040-40498\" data-ref-id=\"3040-40498\">Eiichiro
        Sasaki<\/a> that Leon''s story be tackled first.<\/p><p>Initially Ada''s campaign

        of the four campaigns feature their own unique aesthetic for the HUD<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Resident
        Evil 6 is an action-shooter with an over-the-shoulder perspective in the same
        vein as prior entries, <a href=\"\/resident-evil-4\/3030-1578\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1578\">Resident
        Evil 4<\/a> and Resident Evil 5, though it features a \"totally new control
        scheme\" allowing much more manoeuvrability. This includes the ability to
        now move and shoot similar to the <a href=\"\/nintendo-3ds\/3045-117\" data-ref-id=\"3045-117\">3DS<\/a>
        Resident Evil games, <a href=\"\/resident-evil-the-mercenaries-3d\/3030-32811\"
        data-ref-id=\"3030-32811\">Mercenaries 3D<\/a> and <a href=\"\/resident-evil-revelations\/3030-31737\"
        data-ref-id=\"3030-31737\">Revelations<\/a>, and a full 360 movement scheme
        replacing the series'' long-standing tank controls. Characters can now utilise
        a roll ability to help dodge incoming attacks and also now for the first time
        are able to quickly dive into prone and fire their weapon.<\/p><p>RE6 sees
        the return of <a href=\"\/cover-system\/3015-55\" data-ref-id=\"3015-55\">cover
        mechanics<\/a> along with the newly introduced ability to sprint. While sprinting,
        the character will automatically vault over obstacles and jump across ledges
        without <a href=\"\/parkour\/3015-272\" data-ref-id=\"3015-272\">any additional
        player input<\/a>. Because of the added ability to sprint, characters now
        run automatically by pushing on the analogue stick all the way; pressing it
        gently will have the character walk instead. The player''s camera view has
        also been expanded, now allowing a full 360 degree perspective rather than
        being restricted to as far as the character''s neck can turn.<\/p><p>Additional
        customization options have been afforded for players within the options menu.
        These allow players to now freely switch between aiming from the right side
        or left, to whether or not their weapons will reload automatically, to choosing
        between the new cross-hair or the classic laser sight for aiming their weapons,
        to then even choosing from a small selection of colors for said laser sight.<\/p><h3>Melee
        &amp; Quick Shot<\/h3><p>Melee combat has been heavily streamlined and can
        be utilised at any time--rather than requiring specific context-sensitive
        button prompts--which will allow the player to string together a few simple
        combos using the RT\/R2 button. Context-sensitive prompt attacks are still
        available, however they have primarily been reduced to the available attack
        whence stunning an enemy via a headshot.<\/p><p>Players may attack with a
        dive should they be in the middle of a sprint, and breakable boxes no longer
        require a knife and can instead be automatically destroyed with a regular
        melee attack. To compensate, characters have a stamina gauge that slowly depletes
        (but will recharge) after each melee attack; when timed correctly just before
        an enemy melee attack, the player can do a powerful counter attack. The gauge
        is used up when players make use of the Quick Shot ability, which allows the
        player to swiftly fire off a shot with their equipped weapon complete with
        auto-aim.<\/p><h3>Inventory<\/h3><p>Along with the overall control scheme,
        the inventory system has also been given a complete overhaul, now designed
        as two separate menus for supplies and weapons -- both of which the player
        must scroll through horizontally. The player may now move while perusing their
        inventory, though they control their inventory navigation with the right analogue
        stick temporarily removing control of the in-game camera. The player switches
        between the two menus using the RB\/R1 button by default for the 360 and PS3
        respectively.<\/p><p>Health items can now be used with just a single button
        press as well. For a more convenient approach, the alternative is to use the
        directional buttons (left\/right for weapons, up\/down for supplies) to scroll.
        Items cannot be combined within this menu, however.<\/p><h3>Herbs &amp; First
        Aid Sprays<\/h3><p>Herbs can once again be combined, but this time must be
        converted into ''tablets'', which will allow players to heal themselves with
        just the press of a button rather than having to first select it out of their
        inventory; players can also tap the button consecutively to use multiple tablets
        at once. <a href=\"\/first-aid-spray\/3055-619\" data-ref-id=\"3055-619\">First
        Aid sprays<\/a> must still be equipped for use, however. There exist no blue
        nor yellow herbs this time around and only green and red can be found and
        combined; red herbs still have no effect when used on their own.<\/p><p><b>A
        list of the herb to tablet conversion is as follows:<\/b><\/p><ul><li>Green
        Herb = One tablet<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>Green Herb + Green Herb = Three tablets.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>Green
        Herb + Green Herb + Green Herb = Six tablets.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>Green Herb
        + Red Herb = Six tablets.<\/li><\/ul><p>Should a player take enough damage,
        they will enter into a ''dying state. Here, the player can only crawl, but
        can also pull up their weapon and attempt to defend themselves. Unlike RE5,
        however, the player will eventually bring themselves back off the ground once
        enough time has passed without the player getting attacked; the player''s
        partner character can also still revive the player as well to speed up the
        process. The player is still within the ''dying'' state during this stage
        and must heal themselves, otherwise a single attack will kill them outright.<\/p><h3>Skill
        Settings<\/h3><p>Unlike Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5, players cannot
        buy weapons. Instead players will find all of each respective campaign''s
        weaponry as the story dictates it, and certain weapons are exclusive across
        specific campaigns and even characters. Weapons cannot be upgraded either,
        and now players may purchase ''''Skills'''' and can equip three at a time.
        Players can create up to eight different combinations at once and then choose
        to switch between their configurations mid-game Most, but not all, Skills
        such as Piercing or Defense can be upgraded after they''ve been bought for
        an additional price, increasing their overall effectiveness.<\/p><p><b>A list
        of the Skills are as follows:<\/b><\/p><ul><li><b>Firearm<\/b> - Increases
        firearm power.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Melee<\/b> - Increases power during melee

        cooperative gameplay.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Cooperative play is once again
        featured within the game, with each of the three storylines starring two main
        characters. Leon has Helena Harper at his side, Chris is teamed with BSAA
        marksman Piers Nivans, and Jake Muller is paired with Sherry Birkin. Matchmaking
        has been introduced to allow a more accessible venue for cooperative play,
        including drop-in drop-out capability. When played solo, players can now select
        which of the two main characters to star as, rather than having to complete
        the campaign first to unlock the secondary character. Like in RE5, the other
        character is taken control by an AI should it be a solo game. Though this
        time around there is no inventory management between the two characters, and
        the AI is invincible with infinite ammo.<\/p><p>With each of the three stories
        primarily happening concurrently, this eventually allows certain characters
        to coincide with one another introducing the concept of 4-player cooperative
        play in Resident Evil 6. As long as the player(s) is online, once they reach
        a point in one of the stories (eg. Leon &amp; Helena) where the cast will
        meet up with two from another story (eg. Jake and Sherry), the player is given
        the option to search online for any other player(s) who is currently at the
        same spot with the other characters. From there, the quadruple can then temporarily
        play together to fight against a specific story-dictated boss battle. Otherwise
        the player(s) can opt to fight alongside two temporary friendly AI''s instead.<\/p><h3>Quick
        Time Events<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10354\/2661826-resident-evil-6-screenshot-01.png\"

        once again return, though they are now much more prevalent overall than previous
        games in the series. They are still most commonly encountered should a player
        be grabbed by an enemy or in the case of bosses to sometimes avoid an attack
        entirely. Though unlike in Resident Evil 5 for example, some enemies will
        require the player to complete multi-tiered QTEs in a row, such as wiggling
        the stick and then having to time a button press afterwards to throw the enemy
        off.<\/p><p>They are also encountered during specific cutscenes, where the
        player must press the on-screen prompts as they appear otherwise they will
        die. Sometimes players may also have to rapidly tap a single button as well,
        usually as a means to further illustrate a scene depicting a struggle for
        example. Not only do they occur during cutscenes, but even during in-game
        events as well. This includes a QTE involving the player dodging an incoming
        train, to one that has players climbing up a long string of rope by alternating
        between R2\/RT and L2\/LT at a specific pace.<\/p><p>If playing cooperatively,
        cutscene QTEs are divided between players depending on which character is
        doing the action on-screen. Though there are still some that require both
        players to press the prompts simultaneously.<\/p><p>Via an online patch, a
        setting was added so as to make cutscene QTEs automated with no fail state.
        However in-game QTEs will still persist.<\/p><h3>New Game+<\/h3><p>Like past
        Resident Evil games, Resident Evil 6 allows players to go through any of the
        completed campaigns with all the weapons they''ve found and as much ammo and
        healing supplies as how they left it. When playing through the already completed
        campaign with the alternate character, however, the player will begin with
        that character''s default equipment only and will have to collect the campaign''s
        set of weapons again. Though even when heading again with the same character
        as they completed the game with, the game will also give players the option
        to play through again with the character''s default equipment should they
        so desire.<\/p><h2>Characters<\/h2><h3><a href=\"\/leon-s-kennedy\/3005-649\"

        can equip multiple types of grenades. There are regular grenade rounds, acid
        rounds, and freeze rounds. The grenade rounds deal heavy explosive damage
        with plenty of splash damage to go with it; acid will continually do damage
        over time; and freeze rounds will instantly freeze all common enemies - from

        Evil 6 sees the return of the classic slow, shambling zombies that hounded
        the heroes of the series up until Resident Evil 4. This particular iteration
        of the zombie is much more advanced over the usual zombies from the past,
        however. They''re much faster, agile, and can even leap a small distance through
        the air to attempt to grab the player by surprise.<\/p><p>Their main source
        of attack is to grab and start biting the player, requiring the player to
        wiggle the stick to escape without any partner character assistance. Sometimes
        if a zombie is weak enough there''ll be a two-part QTE; the first involves
        wiggling the stick, and the second involves a timed button press which will
        result in the player character killing the zombie. During the first phase
        the player will continually take damage, though no such damage is inflicted
        during the second.<\/p><p>Zombies will also sometimes spit acid at the player.
        While the damage is minimal, it will force the player to have to wait through
        a prolonged animation before they regain control.<\/p><p>Furthermore, these
        zombies are occasionally seen to wield melee weapons--which they groggily
        attempt to attack the player with--such as pipes, axes, bottles, and can also
        even use firearms -- specifically the Assault Rifle for Special Tactics and
        the Elephant Killer. Though much like their effectiveness with melee weapons,
        zombies have poor accuracy and tend to lamely fire aimlessly until they run
        out of ammo and then throw the gun at the player. While zombies are still
        generally sluggish in movement, this iteration of the undead has the capacity
        to climb ladders.<\/p><p>There are a few zombie variations throughout the
        game. Beyond the regular civilian zombies, there are firefighters that have
        their extinguishers still residing on their back. Shooting it will create
        a small explosion that''ll kill the zombie and at least do damage to any nearby
        zombies. BSAA zombies will also be encountered, which due to their body armor
        are immune to regular gunfire in all but their head. Finally there are the
        more rotten, decayed zombies of the catacombs, which can sometimes be found
        wearing armor on their torso and head. This''ll then make them immune to most
        forms of gunfire. Some catacomb zombies can also be found strapped with dynamite
        around them, which when shot will of course result in a small explosion, potentially
        damaging if not killing any other nearby zombies.<\/p><p>Zombies are primarily
        encountered across all of Leon S. Kennedy''s campaign, though they do still
        make an occasional appearance during portions of Ada Wong''s as well.<\/p><h3><a

        Sort of resembling the Crimson Head zombies from the Resident Evil remake,
        Bloodshots are significantly more durable than regular zombies and will often
        attempt to leap at the player and bite them, doing a sizeable amount of damage.
        Their one weak spot is their heart, which sporadically reveals itself beneath
        the hard-casing that has formed around it. Melee attacks aren''t as effective
        as against regular zombies, however, though continuous firearm fire is still
        a viable solution for taking down a Bloodshot. Countering their leap attack
        will also deal a significant amount of damage.<\/p><p>Because these are an

        many bullets to kill. If they''re close enough to the player character the
        player can do a prompted stomp attack, which''ll deal minor damage.<\/p><p>Their
        main source of attack is leaping at the player and munching on their neck,

        hit their mark. Because they have no laser-sight for their weapon this can
        thusly make it difficult to pinpoint their location at that. J''avo with Sniper
        Rifles are equally as damaging and a single shot from one will knock the player
        over, though unlike the RPG J''avo their sniper rifles are fitted with a laser-sight
        to help notify the player of their position.<\/p><p>The J''avo are faced across
        chapters set in Edonia, China, and Neo-Umbrella''s underwater base, however
        the differences between the three are purely cosmetic. They are also fought
        across all campaigns besides Leon''s.<\/p><h3>J''avo Mutations<\/h3><figure

        the Ganado and Majini before them, J''avo have a high chance to mutate whence
        enough damage has been sustained. However the variety of mutations is far
        greater and is dependant on which part of the J''avo''s body is damaged. J''avo
        can sometimes undergo two mutations at that before finally dying.<\/p><p>When
        going through the mutation the J''avo temporarily gains an exceptional increase
        in defense, and even then their overall defensive properties will have increased
        when the mutation has finished. Furthermore, contrary to Ganado\/Majini mutations,
        their mutated body part will be much more resistant to damage than the rest
        of their body.<\/p><h4>Glava-Sluz<\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\"

        very fast and mobile monster that resembles a lizard of sorts. It can very
        quickly scurry throughout the area, often rushing past the player to knock
        them aside a little--the player will receive no damage during this action,
        though--and can crawl up and around walls. Its main source of attack is to
        shoot a swath of needles from its chest, which if one hits the player will
        knock them over to the ground. It also sometimes spew a sort of acidic liquid
        should players be close enough, which can potentially keep a player stunlocked
        without assistance from their partner character.<\/p><p>Strelats weakness
        is against melee attacks. Should one be stunned, either by gunfire of a flashbang,
        the player can enact a QTE that involves three button prompts, each of which
        will show the character kicking the creature''s torso before then doing a
        roundhouse kick against it. The roundhouse kick will always end the combo,
        even should a player fail the QTE.<\/p><h4>Napad<\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\"

        to damage. It also has a notary weak-point on its back.<\/p><p>While Napads
        are slow in movement, its primary attack involves it charging towards the
        player in its attempt to ram the player over; it''ll start beating its chest
        to signify when it''s ready to charge. Players can attempt to get out of the
        way, though there''s also a QTE prompt that''ll show up for the player to
        jump over the beast before it hits.<\/p><p>Beyond charging, it''ll attempt
        to to punch the character when close enough. Napads can potentially explode
        should be they killed with an explosive weapon, though if they''re killed
        with melee attacks or firearm fire it will wildly swing its arms around as
        a final attack before it succumbs to death.<\/p><h4>Mesets<\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\"

        Part I<\/h4><p> <\/p><p> <\/p><h2>Unlockables<\/h2><h3>Mercenaries<\/h3><p>Returning
        once more is the popular Mercenaries minigame, which is pretty much an exact
        replica of the Resident Evil 5 iteration, and is unlocked by completing the
        Prelude. Starting with 2 minutes, players are to kill as many enemies as possible
        within the time limit. Where RE6''s Mercenaries differ is the addition of
        an enemy counter, which shows how many enemies out of a set amount of spawns
        on the map the player has killed. The more enemies the player kills, the more
        aggressive the enemies get, and will also begin spawning sub-bosses as well.<\/p><p>Players
        can extend their overall time by finding and destroying Time Bonuses throughout
        the map, and any enemies that are killed via a melee attack will grant the
        player an additional few seconds. Mercenaries can be played cooperatively
        for up to 2 players in both local split-screen and online.<\/p><p>By default
        there are only three characters available and one map. More characters are
        unlocked by attaining a B rank on each map, and two more maps are unlocked
        by completing both Chris and Jake''s campaigns - one per campaign. Alternate
        costumes are also available, and are unlocked per character by attaining an
        A rank with the character itself. Much like in RE5, each of the character''s
        alternate costumes will have a different set of weapons and supplies.<\/p><p>Like
        the main campaign, skills are available for players to purchase with in-game
        points and equip, though only one Skill may be equipped at a time. These Skills
        are also completely separate from the ones in the main game, and the player''s
        point currency is unique to Mercenaries and doesn''t carry over, nor can it
        be imported, from the main game. Instead players must collect Skills points
        from defeated enemies in the Mercenaries mode itself.<\/p><p><u><b>Characters:<\/b><\/u><\/p><table><thead><tr><th>Character

        Evil 6 had been stirring within the public''s mind for a while. Rumors and
        small tidbits referencing the game''s development began circulating during
        <a href=\"\/e3-2011\/3015-6449\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6449\">E3 2011<\/a>, when
        a logo for Resident Evil 6 was posted, along with the date to the same year''s
        <a href=\"\/tokyo-game-show\/3015-2306\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2306\">TGS<\/a>
        show. Nothing Resident Evil-related occurred during the TGS show, however
        a trailer was released on September 16th, implying that Resident Evil 6 was
        to be set in Canada. The trailer was soon shot down by Capcom as a fake. The
        next batch of rumors began pointing towards China, after a voice actress''
        resume was found to state she would be portraying a ''''Chinese zombie''''
        for Resident Evil 6.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10354\/2109982-date.jpg\"

        a similar move during Resident Evil 5''s marketing, Capcom began a purposely
        shoddy looking viral campaign called NoHopeLeft.com, which sprinkled random
        blogs and notes much like for some sort of conspirators website, detailing
        how the entire world is under siege. Only one day before the d\u00e9but trailer,
        the site posted a movie of a greatly distressed Chinese woman making a vlog
        for a loved one, under the guise of a civilian currently in the midst of whatever
        catastrophe is going on. It cuts out as she is seemingly attacked by something.
        Soon afterwards, another video is posted just with the date and time of ''''01.19.12
        14:00 PST''''. Without fail, the site then posted a link to the d\u00e9but
        Resident Evil 6 trailer at 2pm Pacific the next day with the words ''''This
        explains a lot!!!!''''.<\/p><p>Continuing the viral campaign, on February
        21st the <i>nohopeleft<\/i> website was ''''seized and put under investigation'''',
        with a logo not seen before within the series at the bottom of the page linking
        a downloadable audio file titled ''''praying audio''''. Much like the title
        implies, it plays a short 14 second clip of a young Chinese woman (possibly
        the same one from the vlog) praying in her native language.<\/p><p>While originally
        slated for a 11\/20\/12 release, come the Captivate trailer in April, the
        date was pushed forward to 10\/02\/12. Despite only being announced early
        2012, Capcom stated that development for Resident Evil 6 had been going on
        since 2010. It was also stated to be the ''''largest'''' Resident Evil game
        to date, and the Capcomteam working on it was the biggest one they had working
        on a single game --approximately 600 people. For comparison''s sake, roughly
        around 120 people worked on Resident Evil 5. Capcom said that with Resident
        Evil 6, they want to combine the series strongest elements of horror and action;
        executive producer <a href=\"\/hiroyuki-kobayashi\/3040-32924\" data-ref-id=\"3040-32924\">Hiroyuki
        Kobayashi<\/a> coined the term ''''dramatic horror'''' to best summarise their
        ambitions, in an attempt to replicate Mikami''s original fame for creating
        the <a href=\"\/survival-horror\/3015-4801\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4801\">Survival
        Horror<\/a> moniker. The popular military-shooter series <a href=\"\/call-of-duty\/3025-82\"
        data-ref-id=\"3025-82\">Call of Duty<\/a> was recurrently bought up as influential--notably
        regarding its sales--in how Capcom decided to steer forward the next instalment
        of the Resident Evil series.<\/p><h3><a href=\"\/e3-2012\/3015-7024\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7024\">E3
        2012<\/a><\/h3><p>At the Electronic Entertainment Expo''s Microsoft Conference,
        Hiroyuki Kobayashi and Eiichiro Sasaki took to the stage to unveil their first
        trailer showing off unedited gameplay, focussing on Leon''s story, for Resident
        Evil 6.<\/p><p>Only minutes after the Microsoft Conference was over, Capcom
        uploaded another cinematic trailer surrounding the plot of the game. On the
        show floor, multiple streams showing off small segments of Leon''s, Chris''
        and Jake''s stories were shown as well, along with further explanation for
        the gameplay debut of 4-player boss battles.<\/p><h3>SDCC 2012<\/h3><p>After
        the overall poor reception of the 360 demo released on July 3rd--most notably
        regarding the camera and screen-tearing--Capcom quickly saw fit to showcase
        a more updated edition of Resident Evil 6, including a much more manageable
        camera with the character model not taking up so much of the screen, and improved
        technical aspects. Capcom also used this opportunity to introduce more segments
        for each of the campaigns, as well as upload another edited story trailer.<\/p><h3>Street
        Date Broken<\/h3><p>On August 31st, more than a month before Resident Evil
        6''s officially scheduled release, a few copies of the full game--PS3 version--were
        made available for retail sale in the Polish City of Pozna\u0144. Capcom quickly
        reported that such copies were in fact ''stolen''.<\/p><h2>Logo Controversy<\/h2><figure

        purposely abstract Number ''''6'''' logo for Resident Evil 6 went under some
        scrutiny shortly after it was revealed within the d\u00e9but trailer for its
        appearance - which has been said to resemble a giraffe, whilst wearing a boot,
        receiving fellatio from a woman. It sparked a lot of talk on many forums across
        the internet (most notably 4chan) and was subjected to parody and even drawings
        to better illustrate the ''''hidden image'''' within the number 6 logo.<\/p><p>While
        Capcom didn''t go as far as to acknowledge the fellatio comparison, they were
        open to admitting and making fun of the similarities the logo shares with
        a giraffe via a Facebook update.<\/p><h2><a href=\"\/dragons-dogma\/3030-34776\"
        data-ref-id=\"3030-34776\">Dragon''s Dogma<\/a> tie-in<\/h2><p>To coincide
        with Capcom''s other equally invested IP, Dragon''s Dogma, Capcom slotted
        in a code to unlock a demo for Resident Evil 6 for players who buy new copies
        of Dragon''s Dogma. However, there is a large interval regarding the activation
        dates between the 360 and PS3 versions because of <a href=\"\/microsoft-studios\/3010-340\"
        data-ref-id=\"3010-340\">Microsoft<\/a> paying for temporary exclusivity;
        the 360 demo is available to download on July 3rd, whereas for the PS3 it''s
        September 5th. A public demo was then released for all on September 18th for
        the PS3 and 360 Gold Members (Silver members had to wait until September 25th)
        which contained different sections of gameplay than in the first demo for
        each of the three campaigns.<\/p><p>Capcom have stated that their reasoning
        for separating the demo activation dates as a ''''strategic business decision''''.
        Head of the UK branch David Turner also further elaborated by saying that,
        ''''The dream would be that the millions of Call of Duty fans that are enjoying
        these fast-paced online games are attracted to this Resident Evil'''', implying
        that they''re pushing for the 360 because of its larger player base surrounding
        Call of Duty.<\/p><h3>July 3rd\/September 5th Demo<\/h3><p>At under 1GB, the
        Resident Evil 6 demo included a small excerpt from each of the three campaigns,
        Leon, Chris, and Jake--which were originally shown on the stage-floor of 2012''s
        E3 expo.<\/p><p>Leon''s was situated during the beginning, after he is forced
        to kill the zombified President Adam Benford. Along with Helena, they make
        their way through the Tall Oaks University, before bumping into a lost father
        and daughter who are both infected with the C-Virus, and are eventually forced
        to defend themselves against an onslaught of zombies.<\/p><p>Chris Redfield''s
        begins around the time he and Piers Nivans reunite after their mission in
        Europe 6 months prior. Then, skipping to their mission during China, the two
        fight across the rooftops of Langshiang against a small band of J''avo resistance.
        Jake Muller''s demo gives players the taste of one of Resident Evil 6''s boss
        battles as he along with Sherry do battle with B.O.W. Ustanak programmed by
        Neo-Umbrella to hunt down Jake Muller -- not unlike how The Nemesis stalked
        Jill Valentine during Resident Evil 3.<\/p><p>All three of the campaigns can
        be played solo or online with another player, though not in splitscreen. Should
        players die they must restart the demo level over - there are no checkpoints.<\/p><h3>September
        18th Public Demo<\/h3><p>Sized at 847MB and available for all on both PS3
        and 360, Resident Evil 6''s second demo gave another taste of each of the
        three main campaigns. Alongside that, the demo featured a better optimised
        camera and smoother technical properties.<\/p><h2><a href=\"\/left-4-dead-2\/3030-26782\"

        and Archive collections - a compilation of the main Resident Evil games for
        the PS3 &amp; 360 respectively. The name difference signifies more than just
        console difference, however, as each one features a different selection of

        only to Japan is the Premium Edition, which includes the full RE6 game along
        with four tablet covers and an exact replica of Leon S. Kennedy''s jacket
        during the part in Tall Oaks. Because of the high price of 105,000 yen, otherwise
        roughly conversed as 1,300$, the reaction was tepid at best. Capcom''s official
        US blog, Capcom Unity, held a poll asking their International audience whether
        they wanted the edition to be made available over in the States. Rounded to
        a basis of 100, the poll shown that only 20\/100 votes were in favor of purchasing
        the edition should it be made available.<\/p><h2>PC system requirements<\/h2><h3>Minimum:<\/h3><ul><li>OS:

        new over-the-shoulder aiming system in effect.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Going
        through what could be considered a gameplay reboot, Resident Evil 4 ditches
        many of its survival horror traits in favor of becoming a more accessible
        third-person shooter. Killing enemies is in fact incentivised--in stark contrast
        to the series''s original philosophy--as they will continually drop ammunition
        and gold - to which can be used to upgrade the player''s weaponry. The game''s
        level design is also much more linear in scope and any key items the player
        comes upon will likely be used up mere moments later. Though the player will
        still have to solve numerable puzzles across the game.<\/p><p>The series''
        divisive <a href=\"\/tank-controls\/3015-4647\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4647\">tank
        controls<\/a> are still in effect, though are ameliorated by an <a href=\"\/over-the-shoulder\/3015-2621\"
        data-ref-id=\"3015-2621\">over-the-shoulder<\/a> perspective and this, with
        the addition of <a href=\"\/laser-sight\/3055-1819\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1819\">laser
        sights<\/a>, improves weapon aiming. Player characters cannot ''run n gun'',
        however, and any attempt at firing a weapon requires that the player must
        first perch themselves to the ground in classic Resident Evil fashion. Although
        unlike most shooters, the common enemies the player will come into conflict
        with--while not technically zombies--are generally slow in movement and almost-exclusively
        use melee weapons.<\/p><p>A dedicated <a href=\"\/knife\/3055-295\" data-ref-id=\"3055-295\">knife<\/a>
        button allows <a href=\"\/close-quarters-combat\/3015-865\" data-ref-id=\"3015-865\">close-quarters
        combat<\/a> without an inventory visit, reinforcing a faster pace of action.
        Switching firearms still requires the player to return to the inventory menu,
        however. <a href=\"\/context-sensitive\/3015-190\" data-ref-id=\"3015-190\">As
        first introduced in <\/a><a href=\"\/resident-evil-3-nemesis\/3030-5587\"
        data-ref-id=\"3030-5587\">Resident Evil 3: Nemesis<\/a>, simultaneously pressing
        back and the ''run'' button will have Leon do a 180 degree turn.<\/p><p>By
        default RE4 has two difficulty settings, Easy and Normal. Upon completing
        the game will a higher setting become unlocked, called Professional Mode.
        Each difficulty increases the attack &amp; damage modifiers up from the last.<\/p><h3>Melee
        Attacks<\/h3><p>Another new mechanic is that of melee attacks. While Leon
        will forever have his knife available, he can also perform a number of button
        prompt melee attacks. These are initiated by first stunning an enemy, which
        is most commonly done by shooting it in the face. This will then allow the
        player to perform a roundhouse kick. Shooting an enemy in the leg so it''ll
        fall to its knees will also trigger a melee attack, be it a straight-kick
        or a suplex depending on the type of ganado. Leon is invulnerable amidst the
        melee attack animation, making it efficient for both offensive and defensive
        maneuvers.<\/p><h3>Inventory Tetris<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3381\/284867-s18106_ps2_4.jpg\"

        Attache Case.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Leon''s attache case, unlike inventory
        in the past, is gridded with a number of squares. Items occupy a certain number;
        the player must arrange and re-arrange weapons, ammunition and herbs, among
        other things, to best utilize his space. Using, combining, discarding and
        selling items are all integral to grid management. Larger attache cases can
        be bought. Treasures, which can be sold to the merchant, and key items are
        housed in a separate menu.<\/p><h3>Health &amp; Healing Items<\/h3><p>Another
        alteration from the previous games is the health system. Leon''s health is
        no longer governed by a series of statuses and is now represented by a quarter-circle
        that wraps around the ammo icon. The color scheme still persists, with green
        indicating Leon is in good health, yellow to notify he''s in danger, and red
        as a warning to the player that he is approaching death. When his health goes
        into yellow or red, Leon will be shown to hold onto his side.<\/p><p>Herbs
        are once again available for use, as are first aid sprays. The classic green
        and red varieties persist, although there are no longer any blue herbs as
        the chance of being poisoned has been removed entirely. Though in their stead
        is the introduction of yellow herbs, which can be used to marginally increase
        Leon''s health until it fills the entire three quarter circle. However they
        can only be taken whence they''ve been mixed with at least one green herb.<\/p><p>The
        healing properties of herbs is locked, regardless of how much overall health
        Leon has. This means that at the beginning of the game a single herb can heal
        most of Leon''s current health.<\/p><p>A mixture of herbs and their healing
        effects (when Leon has attained his maximum health limit) are as follows:<\/p><ul><li><b>Green
        Herb<\/b> - On its own will restore 25% of health.<\/li><li><b>Red Herb<\/b>
        - On its own does nothing.<\/li><li><b>Green + Green Herb<\/b> - Mixed will
        heal the character by roughly 50% of health.<\/li><li><b>Green + Green + Green
        Herb<\/b> - Mixed will heal the character completely.<\/li><li><b>Green +
        Red Herb<\/b> - Mixed will heal the character completely.<\/li><\/ul><p>Beyond
        herbs are eggs the player can collect as well. There are three varieties,
        each healing a higher percentage than the last, though eggs cannot be combined
        for greater effects. They are generally found after killing a snake, or by
        chasing a chicken long enough for it to lay an egg. Chickens are only encountered
        in the early stages of the game, and eggs can eventually only be acquired
        by killing a snake.<\/p><p>The three egg types are:<\/p><ul><li><strong>White<\/strong>
        - Roughly heals about 10% of health<\/li><li><strong>Brown<\/strong> - Roughly
        heals about 40% of health<\/li><li><strong>Gold<\/strong> - Will fully heal
        a character.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Secondary Character AI<\/h3><h4>Ashley Graham<\/h4><figure

        key points in the game, the player is tasked with escorting and safeguarding
        Ashley Graham. She functions as her own character with her own health bar,
        however she has no means of attack. Instead, the player can choose between
        telling her to wait or to follow; when told to wait she will stay on the spot
        until told otherwise. When following she will always trail behind Leon, never
        getting in the way of his aim, and will also even duck out of the way should
        Leon''s laser sight happen to cross Ashley.<\/p><p>Besides being told to simply
        wait on the spot, there are a number of trash dumpsters that Leon can tell
        Ashley to hide in; Leon can then whistle to signal it''s safe for her to come
        out. When in a dumpster she is completely hidden from sight from enemies.<\/p><p>Ashley
        is just as vulnerable as Leon and can die from only a couple of attacks. Although
        her health can also be extended much like Leon if she is given a herb mixture
        to heal containing a yellow herb. While she makes a concerted effort to stay
        clear of Leon''s aim, she isn''t invincible to friendly-fire and can be shot
        by the player. Beyond simply being attacked, Ganado will also often attempt
        to carry her away; they will be shown carrying her on their shoulder, and
        should they exit the area then the game will be over. It will only take a
        single shot to knock the Ganado off balance, dropping Ashley in the process.<\/p><p>There
        is one occasion where players will actually take control of Ashley. Still
        without any means of attack, players are to instead crawl under tables to
        maneuver around enemy encounters. Though she can throw lamps at enemies to
        set them on fire, it will only temporarily knock them to the ground. Ashley''s
        segment as such is puzzle focussed, though she can also acquire supplies that
        she''ll then give to Leon when she returns to him.<\/p><p>On other occasions
        Ashley will attempt to operate a piece of machinery while Leon must protect
        her. This includes her turning a number of cranks, to driving a huge bulldozer.
        Players will also sometimes require Ashley''s help to push forward a large
        crate.<\/p><h4>Luis Sera<\/h4><p>During one particular set-piece, players
        will work alongside Luis to defend themselves within a small house from an
        onslaught of Ganado. Luis is equipped with a Red 9 handgun and will make a
        concerted effort to dispatch as many enemies as possible. He will shoot enemies
        off of Leon if he is grabbed by one and will thank the player in kind if they
        return the favor. Like Ashley, Luis will duck if is caught in Leon''s laser
        sight.<\/p><p>Luis has infinite ammo and is invulnerable, and will also drop
        supplies for Leon to collect. However it''s possible for Luis to kill Leon.
        Though while still invincible, if the player shoots Luis five times then a
        short cutscene will trigger, showing Luis gun down Leon with the words ''''Adios,
        Leon...'''', resulting in a game over.<\/p><h4>Dog<\/h4><p>Early in the game,
        the player will likely notice a dog trapped in a bear trap. If freed, the
        dog will arrive to help the player against the first El Gigante encounter.
        While it won''t actually attack the monster, it will furiously bark at it,
        calling its attention away and giving the player ample time to attack. Once
        the boss battle is over the dog will have disappeared and isn''t encountered
        again.<\/p><h4>Mike<\/h4><p>During a late game event, Leon will have air support
        courtesy of a minor character called <a href=\"\/mike\/3005-9954\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9954\">Mike<\/a>.
        Piloting an attack helicopter, he will provide assistance against the ganado
        and also against the turret placements throughout the area. If Leon is too
        close to one of the towers Mike needs to destroy to help Leon advance, he
        will repeatedly yell for Leon to get out of the way until he does so. Mike
        is invincible for this segment and has infinite ammo.<\/p><p>On Professional
        Mode Mike will only shoot down the towers so Leon can progress and will not
        help with any of the turrets or ganado.<\/p><h3>Quick Time Events<\/h3><figure

        of War<\/a>, was a pioneer in implementing QTEs to include some additional
        interaction within the cutscenes. Thus during many of the game''s cutscenes,
        players will be required to quickly press the on-screen prompts to escape
        danger. This can vary from pressing\/mashing the face buttons (sometimes simultaneously),
        to pressing the shoulder buttons, to wiggling the left analogue stick. Failure
        to do so will result in Leon''s gory demise, with each failed cutscene QTE
        featuring a unique death scene.<\/p><p>Outside of cutscenes, QTEs are utilised
        to escape from an enemy that has grabbed by the player, more often than not
        by wiggling the left analogue stick. While failing to meet the QTE demands
        mid-gameplay won''t always result in Leon''s death, it will lead to him taking
        more damage. As with the cutscenes, dying to an in-game QTE struggle will
        sometimes ''reward'' the player with a unique death animation for Leon.<\/p><h3>Shooting
        Range Minigame<\/h3><p>The player, at certain points, gains access to <a href=\"..\/..\/shooting-range\/92-1932\/\"
        rel=\"nofollow\">Shooting Galleries<\/a>. There are four galleries and eight
        courses in total. The player''s tasked with shooting cardboard Ganados while
        avoiding Ashley''s (which deduct points); there is also a Salazar target.
        There is, occasionally, a Ganado with a lighted stick of dynamite that can
        be shot in order to destroy all targets within the vicinity.<\/p><p>Each course,
        amid its action, gives the player a chance to reload; this occurs once per
        course for about three seconds. Points are awarded for hitting enemy targets,
        and a certain number of them unlock bottle cap figurines.<\/p><p>Six bottle
        caps may be won at each range. Upon each completed row of bottle caps, the
        player is awarded money, starting at five thousand and increasing another
        five thousand with each row. One bottle cap may be earned by obtaining 4,000
        points or hitting all enemy targets, while the other five require earning
        3,000 points multiple times. Each course changes its target layout after the
        player obtains a certain number of bottle caps from it. The bottle caps can
        be viewed in the Key Item Inventory. Each bottle cap features an audio clip
        whose quality is similar to actual sound-playing toys.<\/p><p>The points for
        each target are as follows:<\/p><ul><li><strong>Male Ganado:<\/strong> 100
        points, 200 for headshot.<\/li><li><strong>Female Ganado:<\/strong> 200 points,
        300 for headshot.<\/li><li><strong>Ashley Graham:<\/strong> Minus 1000 points,
        minus 2000 for headshot.<\/li><li><strong>Ramon Salazar Head:<\/strong> 500
        points.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Saving<\/h3><p>As with the earlier games in the series,
        Resident Evil 4 requires players use one of the numerable typewriters in the
        game to save. Only now the player no longer requires any sort of <a href=\"\/ink-ribbon\/3055-526\"
        data-ref-id=\"3055-526\">item <\/a>before hand and there is a great number
        of typewriters located throughout the game.<\/p><h3>New Game +<\/h3><p>Upon
        completing the game, players can then start a new with all of their upgraded
        weaponry and such right from the start. However this can only be done on the
        same difficulty; any attempt at starting a new game on a different difficulty
        requires players start over from scratch.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><h3>Main Characters<\/h3><h4>Leon

        rel=\"nofollow\">Resident Evil 2<\/a>, is recruited by the Secret Service.
        In 2004, Leon is sent to an isolated village in <a href=\"\/spain\/3035-527\"
        data-ref-id=\"3035-527\">Spain<\/a>. He is tasked with the rescue of President
        Graham''s kidnapped daughter, <a href=\"\/ashley-graham\/3005-3163\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3163\">Ashley<\/a>.<\/p><p>Leon
        is accompanied by two local policemen on his mission. He has radio communications
        with <a href=\"\/ingrid-hunnigan\/3005-5332\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5332\">Ingrid
        Hunnigan<\/a>. The trio approaches the village area, watched. Their car stops
        at a footbridge, which is next to a small house. The policemen, who don''t
        think Ashley Graham is in Spain, don''t assist Leon. He enters the house alone.
        Leon meets a man and asks if he''s seen Ashley; the man brandishes an axe,
        forcing Leon to kill him in self-defense. Leon discovers that a truck has
        pushed the car into a ravine, killing the policemen. The bridge, which Leon
        had crossed, is destroyed. Leon contends with more hostiles, averts traps
        and arrives at a village. From the outskirts, Leon sights the body of one
        policemen burning in a bonfire. The villagers notice Leon and begin attacking
        <em>en masse<\/em>. Leon barricades himself in a house. The villagers, including
        one with a chainsaw, resolve to enter. A church bell rings; the villagers,
        eerily, stop and leave. Leon continues on his quest, killing more villagers,
        dodging boulders and meeting <a href=\"\/the-merchant\/3005-1411\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1411\">a
        merchant of arms<\/a>.<\/p><p>Leon comes face to face with <a href=\"\/bitores-mendez\/3005-5739\"
        data-ref-id=\"3005-5739\">Bitores Mendez<\/a>, the village chief, who knocks
        him out. Leon awakens and finds himself tied to <a href=\"\/luis-sera\/3005-2222\"
        data-ref-id=\"3005-2222\">Luis Sera<\/a>. He is an ex-cop from Madrid who
        had researched for <a href=\"\/los-illuminados\/3015-1745\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1745\">Los
        Illuminados<\/a>. Leon, one by one, discovers Sera''s notes and the role of
        <a href=\"\/osmund-saddler\/3005-4600\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4600\">Lord Osmund
        Saddler<\/a>. He controls the villagers; a parasite called <a href=\"\/las-plagas\/3015-1765\"
        data-ref-id=\"3015-1765\">Las Plagas<\/a> transforms them into Los Ganados
        (\"livestock\"). Saddler has injected Plagas into Ashley, Luis, and Leon,
        and their fates are not unlike the villagers. Saddler plans to have Ashley,
        once transformed, infiltrate the United States. This would allow Los Illuminados
        to take over. Leon, resolute, resumes looking for the president''s daughter.
        He arrives at a lake, where he sees Ganados disposing of the body of the second
        policeman. It is eaten by a monstrous, mutated lizard, Del Lago. Leon faces
        the creature, managing its slay with harpoons. He collapses in a lakeside
        cabin. He has nightmares, due to complications from his infestation. He discovers
        the location of Ashley and doubles back to the church in the village.<\/p><p>On
        his way, he faces El Gigante, an enormous troll-like creature. A dog, if freed
        earlier, will assist Leon during the fight. Leon arrives at the church and
        saves Ashley. Saddler appears, announcing that the parasite is growing inside
        of their bodies. The two escape and head for the extraction point. They find
        themselves, however, barricaded with Luis in a cabin. They defend against
        a large number of Ganados. Luis parts ways with Leon. The helicopter that
        was supposed to retrieve the two heroes, unfortunately, is shot down. Hunnigan
        reports that a second one should be incoming. Leon sights a castle nearby
        and deems it an optimal hiding place. To access the castle, however, Mendez''s
        glass eye is necessary. Leon confronts Mendez in a barn. Mendez transforms
        into a monster, but Leon attains the eye. Ashley and Leon enter the castle.<\/p><p>They
        discover that the castle is the religious center of Los Illuminados. Monks,
        using catapults and other medieval weapons, try to kill Leon and capture Ashley.
        One of Saddler''s top men, the castle''s castellan, <a href=\"\/ramon-salazar\/3005-4569\"
        data-ref-id=\"3005-4569\">Ramon Salazar<\/a>, jams all of Leon''s communications.
        This prevents communication with Hunnigan, although Salazar frequently calls
        Leon to taunt him. The two fight through the castle. Ashley starts coughing
        blood and, in her panic, she runs into a trap. Leon must save her again. He
        meets ex-colleague <a href=\"\/ada-wong\/3005-1106\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1106\">Ada
        Wong<\/a>, who already saved himself from Mendez. Ada has a private agenda
        (she''s working for \"the Organization\") and remains enigmatic with Leon.
        Before Leon can wrest any information from Ada, she escapes. Leon spots Ashley,
        just out of reach. Luis arrives, flashing two antidotes and the mysterious
        \"Sample\", which Saddler needs, as Ada (per order of <a href=\"\/albert-wesker\/3005-627\"
        data-ref-id=\"3005-627\">Albert Wesker<\/a>). Unfortunately, Luis is impaled
        by Saddler before any exchange occurs. Leon swears to avenge Luis. He frees
        Ashley, who treks alone through the castle and then reunites. They set off
        again. Ashley, shortly, is captured by Novistadors.<\/p><p>Leon makes his
        way to Salazar, killing <a href=\"\/verdugo\/3005-5922\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5922\">Verdugo<\/a>,
        Salazar''s \"right hand\" and chief bodyguard. He''s informed that Ashley
        has been taken to a research facility on a nearby island. Salazar transforms
        into a giant, mutated creature. A boss fight commences. Leon rides to the
        island with Ada and fights Saddler''s heavily armed Ganados. He finds Ashley,
        finally, along with the \"Sample\" and a machine, which uses electricity and
        radiation to destroy Plagas within a host. Ashley and Leon free themselves
        of infestation and attempt to leave; they are confronted by Saddler. He transforms
        into a crab-like monster and attacks. Leon, with the help of Ada, manages
        to kill Saddler. They end the threat of Los Illuminados, once and for all.
        Ada does, however, steal the \"Sample\" from Leon and sets the island blow.
        Leon and Ashley have three minutes.<\/p><p>The two manage to escape on a jet
        ski, just seconds before the island blows. From the impact, Ashley is flung
        from the vehicle; Leon briefly searches for her, and then picks her up. As
        Leon does so, he says, \"Let''s go home\". In agreement, Ashley responds:
        \"mission accomplished\". A scene is shown of the two traveling into the ocean,
        Ashley asks Leon: \"After you take me back to my place, how about we <a href=\"\/sex\/3015-561\"
        data-ref-id=\"3015-561\">do some overtime<\/a>?\". Leon politely refuses.<\/p><h2>Weapons<\/h2><h3>Merchant<\/h3><p>Throughout

        stats, a \"1.0\" is considered equal to the damage of a single bullet from

        gone are the slow, shambling zombies of the series, and in their stead are
        the Ganado. While still rather slow in movement, the Ganado are much more
        intelligent and capable than your average zombie. They are shown to work in
        groups, can wield a variety of weaponry, climb ladders, and will make an effort
        in keeping their head clear from the player''s laser sight. Though while they
        are of a much greater intelligence than zombies, their infected state via
        a nerve-attached parasite leaves them to act rather sluggish and are much
        slower to react than an ordinary person. But on the flipside they don''t respond
        to pain quite as vividly as a person would. A shot to the face will make them
        temporarily stagger in pain, but only for a few seconds before they return
        to their advance.<\/p><p>They have few defensive abilities and will generally
        attempt to swarm the player via their larger numbers and sheer aggression.
        Though to account for the player''s inability to move &amp; shoot, they will
        rush towards the player only before slowing down to walking speed when they
        reach a certain proximity. As such, the Ganado still retain numerous zombie-like
        qualities despite being of a much more aggressive design.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\"

        for the head is still a suitable tactic, and may result in the head being
        completely destroyed, though shooting other regions can be beneficial as well.
        Players can shoot their arm to make them drop their weapon should they have
        one equipped, and if a Ganado is in mid-sprint then shooting their legs will
        have him topple to the floor, leaving him extremely vulnerable to attack.
        Ganado won''t bite players, but if one gets close enough then they''ll grab
        and attempt to strangle the player character; Leon''s health will begin to
        deplete all the while this is happening. Wiggling the stick will eventually
        knock them away, and may even result in destroying their head amidst the animation,
        though if the player fails the QTE then Leon will be thrown to the floor dealing
        a sizeable amount of damage.<\/p><p>If a Ganado has a weapon, it will often
        use it as a melee weapon, but will sometimes instead hurl it at the player
        - to which can be shot out of the air by the player. Once thrown the ganado
        will then pull out another from its back pocket.<\/p><p>There are three distinct
        varieties of Ganado, one for each of the three main environments of the game.

        much more damage than the villagers and wield more effective weaponry. These
        range from scythes to flails, and are also sometimes equipped with wooden
        shields. The shields can be shot through with a single shotgun round, but
        can otherwise prove to be a danger when multiple are advancing unto Leon while
        equipped with shields. The shields themselves can be used as a weapon as well,
        which will knock Leon to the ground.<\/p><p>As with the villagers they will
        sometimes throw their scythes, which have the potential to decapitate Leon
        killing him immediately. Should they throw their scythe they will from them

        ranged they rely on crossbows. They don''t deal a lot of damage per shot,
        but are instead meant to harass from afar. Only one shot can be fired at time
        before they must reload at least. Some Cultists will also be encountered while

        and occasionally RPGs. Though they also have cattle prods which deal a heavy
        amount of damage even over other melee weapons. Some are also shown to be
        wearing a helmet, which like the cultist masks means this ganado is invincible
        to any shots to the head.<\/p><p>There is a type of militia ganado that is
        much taller and heavily armored than the rest. It is armored over much of
        its torso and most of its head, and wields a huge hammer. Its movement is
        slower than that of a regular ganado, but its attacks deal more damage and
        it can withstand more damage before dying.<\/p><h3>Ganado Plagas Mutations<\/h3><p>At
        a certain point in the story, the las plagas parasite will sometimes be shown
        to burst out of its host after the ganado has received a certain amount damage.
        Whether a ganado will mutate or not is random, though upon doing so all previous
        damage is made redundant and the ganado will have regained full health.<\/p><h4>Plagas
        A<\/h4><p>The most common plagas among all ganado. The plagas A is a small,
        bulbous collection of eyes and tentacles, one of which will stretch out to
        reveal a sharp axe-like end that it''ll use to strike at the player. Shooting
        the plagas is the primary means by which to now kill the creature, as well
        as to force the axe tentacle to recede back for a split-second.<\/p><h4>Plagas
        B<\/h4><p>Plagas B are first encountered when going up against the cultists,
        but also appear amongst the Militia Ganado. This plagas resembles a small
        sort creature, though once it gets close will rapidly increase in size and
        attempt to bite the player character''s head clean off. As with Plagas A,
        shooting the plagas itself will force it to recede away for a split-second
        so as to halt its instant-kill attack.<\/p><h4>Plagas C<\/h4><p>The final
        plagas mutation. Plagas C is first shown to be a bunch of skittering legs,
        which will shoot acid at the player from a distance. After it receives enough
        it damage, it will then separate from its host completely and operate independently
        as a sort of arachnid-like creature. Though once it''s become separated it
        is now extremely vulnerable and will die by but a few handgun shots or knife
        swipes.<\/p><p>Plagas C will on very few occasions be encountered independent
        of any host.<\/p><h3>Chainsaw Ganado<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\"

        extremely dangerous mini boss enemy of sorts. As their name implies, Chainsaw
        Ganado are equipped with a chainsaw, which is an instant-kill should they
        get close enough to Leon. Besides their powerful offensive capabilities, Chainsaw
        Ganado can withstand a much higher degree of damage than regular ganado. Though
        they''ll be knocked to the ground like any other, and as such can be stunlocked
        so long as the player has the ammunition. A Chainsaw Ganado will always drop
        a valuable jewel upon their death, if not 10,000 gold.<\/p><p>There are two
        cosmetic varieties of Chainsaw Ganado, though they each share the same properties.
        Chainsaw Ganado are only encountered in the village and mine environments
        of the game. An alternate name for the Chainsaw Ganado is ''Dr. Salvador'',
        as that''s the name for the Chainsaw Ganado bottlecap. While they wear a burlap
        sack over their head, it doesn''t increase their head defense. Chainsaw Ganado
        will also never mutate.<\/p><p>There are a pair of sisters that wield chainsaws
        as well which are encountered during one specific segment of the game. Despite
        their different appearance they still function the exact same as a regular

        will unleash their plagas parasites, which burst out of their back and can
        then be used as a long range series of whips. Though unlike ganado plagas

        a split-second chance to press a button prompt to counter the ambush. When
        they''ve been attacked they''ll temporarily lose their invisibility, though
        can still regress back into it in order to escape and try again. It primarily
        attacks by slashing when up close or doing a dive-kick when further away,
        which if hit will knock Leon right to the ground.<\/p><p>The second variety
        is always visible, though they have the ability of flight. They also have

        vicinity and madly swing around the area. Their other most notable attack
        is their charging lunge attack, to which will kill a player instantly should
        they get caught by it. It may alternatively lead to the Garrador getting its

        weapon the suit is equipped with--be it an axe or sword--to attack the player.
        Due to their armor they are highly resistant to damage and can be difficult
        to make flinch. After enough damage the plagas will burst from the helmet,
        revealing itself. Damage dealt to the plagas is now the most effective, though
        the creature is still highly resistant to flinching all the same. What plagas

        of the most formidable enemies in the game. Regeneradors are first made known
        during the Island segment of the game. As their name implies, they have the
        unique ability to regenerate any and all wounds the player inflicts. The only
        way to permanently kill a regenerador is to kill the plagas parasites within.
        Players can simply keep shooting at the creature in the hopes of hitting one,
        though by this point players will have access to a thermal scope to attach
        onto their semi-auto sniper rifle. With this players can pinpoint exactly
        where the parasites are. There are usually between 3-4; on Professional Mode
        there is always one on its back. The way to note if the player has shot one
        of its parasites is if the regenerador''s whole body temporarily wobbles and
        expands. Once all parasites have been killed it will explode.<\/p><p>Regenerador''s
        attacks are extremely powerful. It will primarily attack by getting close
        to the player to then rapidly munch on Leon''s neck, requiring the player
        to wiggle the stick to escape. Though while it will at least walk slowly towards
        the player, its leg can be temporarily destroyed to slow it down even further.
        However its range of attack will actually increase without its legs, as from
        there it will leap off the floor a surprising distance to bite the player
        as before.<\/p><p>There exists an alternate variety to the regenerador called
        an Iron Maiden. Its one distinctive difference is that its body is comprised
        of a number of spikes, and if close enough will extend all of its spikes simultaneously
        at the player.<\/p><p>A sure way to note if a regenerador\/iron maiden is
        within the vicinity is its distinct breathing that can carry across the whole
        area.<\/p><h3>Gatling Gun Ganado<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\"

        is encountered amidst the militia ganado. They have available a gatling gun
        with infinite ammo, which has a high range of attack. If the player is caught
        within its stream, it will only count as a single attack with a few brief
        seconds of invulnerability, allowing the player a chance to escape the weapon''s
        range. If he can get close enough, he can also use his gatling gun as a melee
        weapon to knock Leon to the ground.<\/p><p>Gatling Gun ganado are pretty resistant
        to damage, though they can be temporarily stunned after enough shots to the

        design. Leon is instead riding a small dinghy boat with access to an unlimited
        supply of harpoons. After its anchor accidentally gets stuck on the creature,
        the boat is thusly pulled along the river. Players still have some control
        of the boat all the while and must thusly try to steer it away from the debris
        in the water, otherwise the collision will deal damage. All the while this
        is happening, the player can also throw harpoons at the creature. Though the
        animation for such is relatively lengthy and only allows the throwing 3-4
        harpoons before it dives underwater.<\/p><p>During certain periods, Leon will
        completely lose track of the creature as the boat comes to a standstill. However
        it isn''t long before waves begin swarming towards the boat; the screen will
        post arrows on the screen to point the player to the direction of the creature.
        Once it gets close enough it''ll open its mouth, revealing the las plagas
        parasite; damage to this area is higher than anywhere else, and is necessary
        to halt its advance otherwise it''ll slam into the boat dealing a high degree
        of damage.<\/p><p>Once enough damage has been done, the game will shift to
        a cutscene depicting Leon''s leg being caught on a string of rope that''s
        being pulled by the monster. The player must now mash the alternating face
        buttons in order for him to successfully cut the rope off.<\/p><p>Before the
        battle begins, Leon can potentially witness a short cutscene depicting one
        of the Spanish police officers that drove him here being dumped in the water
        to be eaten by Del Lago by heading up the alternate pathway. Upon reaching
        the boat, players can also shoot the river from their position, which will
        result in a unique death scene of Del Lago bursting out of the water to devour
        Leon.<\/p><h3>El Gigante<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\"

        is perhaps considered to be one of the game''s most iconic boss battles. The
        El Gigante is a recurring boss that can be fought across the game up to three
        times, though only two are mandatory. El Gigante is huge, lumbering monstrosity,
        that uses sheer brute strength to kill anything that stands in its way.<\/p><h4>First
        Battle<\/h4><p>The first time Leon encounters the beast makes for the second
        boss encounter in the game. El Gigante is fought amidst a roughly circular
        arena, with some nearby huts that contain some additional supplies. However
        they are easily trounced by El Gigante should players attempt to take shelter
        for too long inside one.<\/p><p>El Gigante attacks with sheer brute force,
        as it stomps towards Leon in its attempt to grab and then squeeze to death.
        Should this happen the player needs to wiggle the stick to escape its grasp,
        with Leon stabbing its hand with his knife dealing minor damage in the process.
        If the player attempts to run underneath his legs, he will then do a swift
        kick forward - potentially knocking the player over to the ground if caught
        by it. It will also pick up a huge tree log and will horizontally swing to
        and fro; the player will be given a QTE prompt to avoid the attacks.<\/p><figure

        to its size it''s easy for the player to deal damage to it, though it''s rather
        resistant all the same. Grenades work well in particular, as do flash grenades
        as well in temporarily halting his advance allowing the player to fire at
        him safely. After sustaining enough damage, it will then keel over in pain
        as a giant las plagas parasite bursts out of its back. From here the player
        can shoot at the plagas, run up and press the button prompt to initiate a
        QTE where Leon slashes at it with his knife, or both. So long as the player
        knows to start running towards it to initiate the QTE, it''s possible to get
        in some shots without sacrificing the QTE chance. After about three such occurrences
        El Gigante will finally fall to the ground dead.<\/p><p>Should the player
        have freed the dog from the bear trap much earlier in the game, it will then
        arrive to provide assistance for the battle. It won''t attack El Gigante but
        will instead bark at it to gain its attention, allowing the player a prime
        opportunity to unload into it.<\/p><h4>Second Battle<\/h4><p>The second battle
        plays out similarly as above beyond a few differences. The first is that the
        player is currently escorting Ashley Graham, who can also be killed by El
        Gigante. Furthermore, the battle arena this time is much slimmer than the
        first, with it being near impossible to get around the advance of El Gigante.
        The one upside is that there''s a boulder precariously resting above; if timed
        right, the player can potentially shoot the boulder so it will land on El
        Gigante, dealing a significant degree of damage.<\/p><p>This boss encounter
        is technically optional, as the player is allowed to choose between two pathways
        to proceed. The other of which will instead send the player through a gauntlet
        of ganado. Though at the same time it''s possible for the player to clear
        out both pathways for the sake of acquiring more gold and supplies.<\/p><h4>Third
        Battle<\/h4><p>The third and final fight against El Gigante is mandatory like
        the first. Though what differs here is that the player is forced to fight
        two El Gigantes simultaneously. To even the odds, players can instead head
        to the switch and pull it, opening up the large grate that, if timed right,
        will send one of the El Gigantes into the molten lava below. If players don''t
        close the hatch, however, it''s possible for the dying El Gigante to give
        one last attack before it dies.<\/p><p>Players can instead try to beat them
        both, which while more difficult also results in double the rewards, as the
        one that is sent into the lava takes its loot with it.<\/p><p>The arena is
        more circular like the first, and there exists a ladder the player can climb
        to reach a pulley, which can then be used to send the player to the opposite
        side of the arena, potentially making some distance between them and El Gigante.<\/p><h3>Bitores

        ''''Big Cheese'''' as Luis referred to him. Bitores is as first depicted as
        an incredibly tall person, though his true las plagas form is revealed for
        this boss battle.<\/p><p>The plagas takes the place of his spine, extending
        his already impressive height even further. He also has four new, lengthy
        appendages appointed on to his back, giving him a fair range of attack.<\/p><p>Mendez
        is made up of two stages. The first has him slowly walks towards the player,
        while using his back appendages to attack from afar. The battle arena is largely
        pretty small and makes it very difficult to run past him without fear of getting
        attacked. Though there is an upper level the player can climb one of the three
        ladders to, which contains additional supplies as well as a temporary haven
        from Mendez. Though even if he can''t get up there, his appendages can and
        will attack the player if they stay up there for too long.<\/p><p>His primary
        weak spot is his new plagas spine, which after so much damage will then collapse
        along with his legs. This then initiates Mendez''s second phase, to where
        he''ll rely on his plagas appendages on his back to swing about throughout
        the area. This gives him an increased level of mobility. He will now attack
        by slashing with his own hands, and can keep track of the player much more
        acutely, such as by now leaping to the upper level of the area. Mendez''s
        weak point is now his head, to which grenades and the few red explosive barrels
        located around the area work especially well.<\/p><h3>Verdugo<\/h3><figure

        ''''right hand'''', Verdugo is one of two mysterious creatures that serves
        Salazar. The first part of the battle has Leon attempt to avoid its attacks
        from the ceiling via QTEs. After reaching the console to turn the power for
        the elevator on, the room goes into lockdown. Then after turning the button
        on to try and unlock the door, Verdugo finally makes its appearance.<\/p><p>At
        this point the player is unlikely to kill Verdugo and must try to survive
        until the door opens. Once that happens the player can then attempt to wait
        and survive until the elevator is powered with more room to maneuver, thereby
        skipping the boss. Verdugo is nigh immune to regular gunfire, and must first
        be encased in nitrous oxide if the player aims to kill it, or wants to at
        least stall it while the elevator makes its descent. Fortunately there just
        so happens to be a number of NO canisters within the vicinity. Whence frozen
        the player is to unload whatever they have into it before it breaks out of
        the NO. Verdugo will routinely hound the player amidst the wait and many of
        its attacks require a successful QTE prompt to avoid.<\/p><p>Verdugo''s patterns
        will remain as such, and the player is to continue utilising the canisters
        if they wish to kill it. Though there are only so many canisters available,
        and if they are all used up and Verdugo still lives, it''s advisable the player
        must instead flee. Fleeing, however, will leave the player with zero rewards,
        whereas killing it will reward players with a unique treasure.<\/p><h3>Ramon

        single completion on any difficulty will reward players two new costumes,
        though only one is available on the original GameCube version. All ports thereafter
        include the second. The first is Leon''s classic RPD uniform from Resident
        Evil 2, and the second is a 1930s mobster outfit. While wearing the mobster
        outfit and equipping the Chicago Typewriter, Leon will flip his hat when players
        attempt to reload the infinite ammo tommy gun.<\/p><p>Either costume will
        also change other character''s appearances as well. When wearing the RPD uniform,
        Ashley''s outfit will have changed to a sort of clubbing outfit. When wearing
        the mobster outfit, Ashley will be shown wearing a suit of armor, which not
        only makes her completely invulnerable to damage but also makes her so she''s
        too heavy to be carried off by a Ganado. Ada Wong''s outfit will change as

        minigame stations the player in an area wherein he must survive before chopper
        pick-up. The goal is to gain points by defeating enemies before time expires.
        There are five characters and four areas to choose from. Each character starts
        with different weapons, while each stage is equipped with ammo boxes, bonus
        timers, and time extenders. Three areas are redesigns from the main game,
        and the fourth is new.<\/p><p><b>Scoring<\/b><\/p><p>Upon starting Mercenaries,
        Leon is the only selectable character. To earn additional characters, the
        player must earn four stars on each stage. The village stage unlocks Ada Wong;
        the castle unlocks Krauser; the military base unlocks Hunk; and the water-world
        unlocks Wesker.<\/p><p>An unlockable weapon, the Handcannon, may be earned
        by attaining five stars on every level with all five characters. To earn a
        five star rating, the player must earn 60,000 points.<\/p><p>Below is a complete

        Ways<\/h3><p>Included in the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo Wii versions, Separate
        Ways is an additional 3-5 hour campaign. Separate Ways follows Ada through
        the whole game and consists of 5 chapters, each taking place in a different
        section and time of the game. Players are given a small stash of weapons and
        ammo and can purchase (but not upgrade) weapons from the merchant. All the
        treasures from Leon''s campaign also exist in Ada''s, and in some cases are
        key items in her quest. Each chapter is preceded by a cutscene and ends with
        Ada giving a short audio report on a character vital to that chapter.<\/p><p>In
        Chapter 1, Ada has been tasked by Wesker to retrieve the Las Plagas sample.
        She arrives in the village at around the same time as Leon. Ada observes Leon
        in trouble during his skirmish with the villagers; in order to stop them from
        attacking Leon, she must quickly get to the church and ring its bell.<\/p><p>In
        Chapter 2, Ada has learned that Luis is in possession of the sample, but has
        gone missing. Ada needs to find him ASAP. She starts in Bitores Mendez'' (the
        village chief''s) house and must work her way back to the cabin, where Leon
        finds Luis. When she reaches the cabin, she finds that Leon and Luis have
        just been captured by Mendez. She backtracks to Mendez'' house, just as Mendez
        and Leon meet in the hallway. Ada saves Leon from being killed by Mendez.
        Mendez gives chase to Ada, and tranquilizes her. Ada wakes up on the bloody
        altar found near the lift area, where she is about to be sacrificed by the
        villagers. She escapes, takes the lifts back and fights an El Gigante. She
        runs into Luis, finally, who was exiting the cabin where he and Leon had their
        late night hold-off from the villagers.<\/p><p>In Chapter 3, Ada is still
        in search of the sample held by Luis. The chapter starts at Leon and Ada first
        meeting, which was in the room overlooking the castle''s garden maze. Ada
        flees Leon into the maze, and resolves to find Luis and the sample. Wesker
        orders Ada to kill Leon on sight, so Ada makes a pact to not run into him,
        as she does not want to hurt her former acquaintance. Ada does end up in the
        room of the castle where Leon finds Ashley in the shackles; she hides behind
        a column, as Luis is murderer by Saddler, in front of Leon. Saddler takes
        the sample from the corpse of Luis and escapes. Wesker tells Ada that there
        will be another time to retrieve the sample.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\"

        unleashing fire at the docks.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>In Chapter 4, the
        game jumps ahead to the Island, where Ada and Krauser have become distrustful
        of each other. Krauser is ordered to do the job Ada couldn''t do: kill Leon.
        Ada has to hurry to the room where Krauser and Leon fight, in order to stop
        Krauser. This chapter is the first to take place in an new section of the
        game: a ship dock littered with turrets and cannons. Ada hurries through the
        locale, and after a small scare on one of the ships, she stops the fight and
        saves Leon.<\/p><p>In Chapter 5, the final chapter, the mission is simple:
        retrieve the sample. Taking place at the very end of the game, Ada is making
        her way through the camp Leon had fought through with the help of his helicopter
        buddy, Mike. After she kills the straggler soldiers, she''s confronted by
        Krauser again. This time, however, he wants to fight Ada. This fight takes
        place after Leon had \"killed\" Krauser; however, he is just as tough as he
        was in the Leon fight. Ada dispatches him. She makes her way towards the room
        where Leon and Ashley ran into Saddler. Ada interrupts their confrontation
        and makes the two run away. Ada faces Saddler, who is in a more human form
        than Leon is later exposed to. After the battle seems over, Ada grabs the
        sample; yet, she is captured, this time by Saddler. She wakes up just prior
        to Leon and Saddler''s final fight. Leon releases her. Ada stands back as
        they fight, noticing a rocket launcher. Ada hurries to the launcher, and throws
        it to Leon, who uses it to destroy Saddler once and for all. Ada takes the
        sample from Leon, sets the island to self-destruct, and escapes on a helicopter.
        She returns the Plagas sample to Wesker, however, it is revealed a fake; Ada
        hands the real sample to an unknown, rival organization.<\/p><h3>Professional
        Mode<\/h3><p>Completing the game on Normal difficulty unlocks Professional
        mode, in which enemies have increased health, attack speed and power. Enemy
        drops likely contain more money but less ammo and quick time events require
        quicker mashing and reactions.<\/p><p>Once the player has completed professional

        in 2001. It went through a long development period, during which various versions
        of the game were scrapped. One of its earlier builds was regarded as too great
        a departure from the series and was retooled and re-branded as <a href=\"\/devil-may-cry\/3030-13072\"

        later version bore a greater resemblance to the previous Resident Evil''s,
        retaining fixed camera angles and a focus on exploration and puzzles. Although
        when Leon aimed, the camera would switch to RE4''s over-the-shoulder perspective.
        This version premised Leon''s injection with the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/progenitor-virus\/3015-2049\"
        data-ref-id=\"3015-2049\">progenitor virus<\/a> (as opposed to the parasite,
        Las Plagas) which caused hallucinations, introducing a psychological element
        to the game. Due to a ghostly apparition that wielded a hook for a weapon,
        this version has been coined the Hookman Build. Paul Mercier can still be
        heard providing the voice for Leon''s cries of pain when attacked, and many
        of the build''s sound effects originated from the <a href=\"\/resident-evil\/3030-27715\"
        data-ref-id=\"3030-27715\">2002 Resident Evil remake<\/a>, such as the handgun
        firing, footsteps, and locked door sound effects. QTEs were shown to already
        be in effect for this build; the suits of armor that will attack Leon whence
        he gets close enough is another aspect that made it into the final release.<\/p><p>While
        initially directed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/kazuhiro-aoyama\/3040-41247\">Kazuhiro
        Aoyama<\/a>, who is otherwise best known for directing <a href=\"\/resident-evil-3-nemesis\/3030-5587\"
        data-ref-id=\"3030-5587\">Resident Evil 3: Nemesis<\/a>, troubles in development
        forced the build to be scrapped and for Mikami to then take over. He further
        believed that the Hookman build''s themes were too ''supernatural''. Due to
        the poor sales of the Resident Evil remake back during its exclusivity on
        the Gamecube, Mikami opted to steer the series into a more action-focussed
        design.<\/p><h2>Differences between Regional Versions (JAP, U.S. and PAL)<\/h2><p>Other
        than the game being called BioHazard 4 in <a href=\"..\/..\/japan\/95-37\/\"
        rel=\"nofollow\">Japan<\/a>, there is a more subtle difference between the
        versions concerning Ashley Graham, as her breast size was increased overall
        for the game''s US and PAL release. In addition, the Japanese version cuts
        some scenes featuring Dr. Salavador, the chainsaw Ganados, because of gore
        and violence.<\/p><p>The differences in the PAL version are found in mercenaries
        mode. Throughout each stage, the enemy counts and triggers are lowered, and
        rifle ammo will only appear in quantities of two and three, instead of three
        and five.<\/p><h2>Reception<\/h2><p>Resident Evil 4 was a large departure
        from the past Resident Evil games. <a href=\"..\/..\/capcom\/65-367\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Capcom<\/a>
        stated that Resident Evil sales had been declining for some time, and that
        gamers - and even the producers themselves - were tiring of the old Resident
        Evil formula. Capcom took the risks involved with making changes, and the
        game was a blockbuster hit.<\/p><p>It sold millions of copies, more than any
        other Resident Evil game at the time, and became one of the highest rated
        games ever. It sold so well that Capcom ported the game to the <a href=\"..\/..\/playstation-2\/60-19\/\"
        rel=\"nofollow\">PS2<\/a>, ending the \"<a href=\"..\/..\/gamecube\/60-23\/\"
        rel=\"nofollow\">GameCube<\/a> Only Deal\". It was, moreover, ported to the
        <a href=\"..\/..\/pc\/60-94\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PC<\/a> and then again to
        the <a href=\"..\/..\/nintendo\/65-90\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nintendo<\/a> <a
        href=\"..\/..\/wii\/60-36\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wii<\/a>. The PC port, while
        receiving positive reviews, was criticized for its sub-par keyboard controls,
        lack of mouse support and low quality cut-scenes. Because of Resident Evil
        4''s reception, its controls were kept and improved in <a href=\"..\/..\/resident-evil-5\/61-20569\/\"
        rel=\"nofollow\">Resident Evil 5<\/a>, pushing the action further.<\/p><h2>Ports<\/h2><p>Despite
        Mikami''s intention of making Resident Evil 4 a Gamecube exclusive, the game
        ended up receiving more ports than any other game in the series. The HD remake
        released on Steam in 2014 is officially considered the \"definitive edition\"
        of the game.<\/p><table data-max-width=\"true\"><thead><tr><th>Publication<\/th><th>GameCube<\/th><th>PlayStation

        2<\/h3><p>Released on October 25, 2005 in North America, the PlayStation 2
        features a brand new scenario called \"Separate Ways\", an exclusive campaign
        for Ada Wong. While nothing much was changed in translation, the PS2 version
        was criticized for its inferior graphics.<\/p><h3>PC<\/h3><p>The first PC
        port of Resident Evil 4 was developed by <a href=\"\/sourcenext\/3010-3364\"
        data-ref-id=\"3010-3364\">SourceNext<\/a> in Hong Kong and published by <a
        href=\"\/typhoon-games-ltd\/3010-3146\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3146\">Typhoon
        Games<\/a>. It was released in Japan on May 15, 2007, with March releases
        in Europe, North America and Australia, all of where it was published by <a
        href=\"\/ubisoft-entertainment\/3010-82\" data-ref-id=\"3010-82\">Ubisoft<\/a>.
        This port contains the bonus features from the PS2 version, such as \"Separate
        Ways\", the P.R.L. 412 laser cannon, and a second set of unlockable costumes
        for Leon and Ashley, as well as an easy difficulty level. It also supports
        multiple widescreen resolutions. The shadow and lighting issues were fixed
        in the first and only patch for the game, Version 1.10.<\/p><p>Surprisingly,
        the PC port does not support the mouse.<\/p><h3>Nintendo Wii<\/h3><p>In May
        2007, a re-release version of BioHazard 4 made its way to <a href=\"..\/..\/japan\/95-37\/\"
        rel=\"nofollow\">Japan<\/a>. This did not include any new features, save a
        trailer for <a href=\"\/resident-evil-the-umbrella-chronicles\/3030-11454\"
        data-ref-id=\"3030-11454\">Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles<\/a>; however,
        it did retain extras from the <a href=\"..\/..\/playstation-2\/60-19\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PlayStation
        2<\/a>''s version and the <a href=\"\/gamecube\/3045-23\" data-ref-id=\"3045-23\">GameCube''s<\/a>
        visuals. Widescreen is anamorphic. This version allowed for aiming with the
        Wii''s IR functionality.<\/p><p>The game is compatible with multiple controller
        schemes, including the following.<\/p><ul><li>Wiimote\/Nunchuck<\/li><li>Classic
        Controller<\/li><li>GameCube Controller<\/li><\/ul><h3>iOS<\/h3><p>In July
        2009, an <a href=\"..\/..\/iphone\/60-96\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">iPhone<\/a>
        version of Resident Evil 4 was released on the Japanese iTunes App Store.
        It came to the U.S. store, too; however, it is a drastically inferior, boiled-down
        level-based version of the game, much more arena shooting than adventuring.
        Capcom later created an iPad version.<\/p><h3>Xbox 360 and PS3<\/h3><p>On
        March 23, 2011, Capcom confirmed that Resident Evil 4 HD and <a href=\"..\/..\/resident-evil-code-veronica-x\/61-8402\/\"
        rel=\"nofollow\">Resident Evil: Code Veronica X<\/a> HD would come to <a href=\"..\/..\/xbox-live-marketplace\/60-86\/\"
        rel=\"nofollow\">Xbox Live Arcade<\/a> and the <a href=\"..\/..\/playstation-network-ps3\/60-88\/\"
        rel=\"nofollow\">PlayStation Network<\/a> as two separate downloads, on September
        20, 2011 and September 27, 2011. Though it was also released as a disc compilation
        called the BioHazard Revival Selection, but only in Japan.<\/p><p>The HD version
        features all the extras from the previous releases.<\/p><h3>Steam Version,
        PC<\/h3><p>In January 2014, Capcom announced a new Steam version would release
        February 27th, 2014. It featured a visual overhaul, sixty frame per second,
        optimized wide screen, Steam achievements and trading cards, worldwide leaderboards,
        full-controller support, native keyboard and mouse support, subtitles in common
        languages and all content from previous versions. If the player pre-ordered,
        he received eighty pages of digital art and sixty-two songs in the official
        soundtrack.<\/p><h2>Trivia<\/h2><ul><li>Resident Evil 4 includes many references
        to the Luc Besson movie, <em>L\u00e9on: The Professional. <\/em>Not the least
        of which is of course Leon Kennedy sharing a first name, but also the burst-fire
        handgun Matilda, which references the Natalie Portman character of the same
        name, and the unlockable difficulty setting ''Professional'' referring to
        <em>L\u00e9on''s <\/em>subtitle.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>The dog that Leon can

        Evil Zero plays much like every other Resident Evil game pre-Resident Evil
        4, mixing in third-person combat, exploration, and puzzles. Though like most
        survival horror titles, Resident Evil limits the player character''s capabilities
        beyond the norm and ammunition for their firearms is generally scarce, intended
        to force players to use their supplies wisely and to choose flight rather
        than fight when possible. There are three different difficulty modes available:
        Easy, Normal, and Hard, with each one featuring tougher enemies and less ammunition
        to be found than the last.<\/p><p>By default Zero utilises the notorious ''<a
        href=\"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/tank-controls\/3015-4647\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4647\">tank
        controls<\/a>'' as players move via a third-person perspective throughout
        a number of pre-determined camera angles. Characters also cannot move and
        fire their weapons at the same time, and instead the character will ''perch''
        themselves to the ground when aiming. And while the camera angle perspective
        sometimes tends to purposely obfuscate the player''s view of monsters, characters
        will at least (by default) aim their weapon at the closest enemy when players
        draw their gun. Simultaneously hitting down and the ''run'' button will have
        the player character do a 180 degree turn, as is custom with Resident Evil
        games since <a href=\"\/resident-evil-3-nemesis\/3030-5587\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5587\">Resident
        Evil 3: Nemesis<\/a>.<\/p><p>The story is largely portrayed via in-game cutscenes,
        however there are also a number of Files (diaries, memos ect.) players can
        collect. These will often provide additional insight into the goings on across
        the overall narrative, but some are more vital as they will provide information
        pertaining to solving puzzles or maybe hinting as to where to go next.<\/p><h3>Cooperative

        one primary component that separates it from previous games of the series
        is its two-protagonist setup--being Rebecca Chambers &amp; Billy Coen--each
        of whom can be controlled by the player. When controlling one the other will
        follow closely by default and will attack any encroaching enemies - though
        it will use up any ammo it has access to in the process. It will also fire
        alongside the player at whatever enemy they''re targeted at, though its frequency
        of attack is rather slow. Such behaviour related to its attacking and following
        procedures can be turned off, so it will merely follow the player without
        engaging in combat and\/or will wait on the spot. When travelling together
        the player can control the movement of the alternate character as well with
        the c-stick\/right analogue stick (default GameCube\/PlayStation &amp; Xbox
        controls), though the secondary character will only run via this method and
        cannot walk.<\/p><p>Rather than having both characters following one another,
        players can also split them up. When split up the secondary character will
        await in the area they''re left in until the player takes control, though
        they''re still vulnerable to attack should there be any nearby enemies. If
        the secondary character is being attacked then the player will receive a warning
        over their radio; if players don''t switch to the alternate character to save
        them, there''s a high chance they may perish. This function is forced upon
        the player so as to solve certain puzzles, such as by having one character
        access an area that only he\/she can travel to, while the other sends key
        items and\/or supplies via a dumbwaiter.<\/p><p>While the majority of the
        game plays out with these mechanics in play, there are two occasions where
        the characters are separated without the ability to switch between the two
        for the sake of the story. One sequence forces players to play as Billy, while
        another, much longer segment has players play as Rebecca on her own.<\/p><h3>Playable
        Characters<\/h3><p>Both Rebecca and Billy each have their own strengths and
        weaknesses to help distinguish the two. Due to his experience in the marines,
        Billy is significantly more durable than Rebecca and can withstand more damage
        before dying. His strength also allows him to interact with certain objects
        that Rebecca cannot, though the opposite is also true for Rebecca who can
        access certain areas that Billy cannot due to her smaller size.<\/p><p>Though
        Rebecca can''t withstand nearly as much punishment as Billy, she is the only
        one of the two who can mix herbs, making Billy quite literally the only playable
        characters in the series who cannot mix herbs together. Her medicine case
        that she uses to mix herbs is also used for mixing certain chemicals to solve
        puzzles.<\/p><p>All weapons in the game can be used by both characters largely
        to the same effect.<\/p><h3>Inventory<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\"

        inventory system for Zero received a slight overhaul from previous games.
        Each of the two characters has their own six-slot inventory, to which they
        can trade items between each other at will so long as they''re in the same
        room. However there are no <a href=\"\/item-box\/3055-6126\" data-ref-id=\"3055-6126\">item
        boxes<\/a> to be found in the game. Instead players can opt to drop items
        onto the ground, to which will persist there until\/if it is collected. Any
        dropped items will also show up on the map.<\/p><p>Each character has their
        own personal item that''s housed in a separate inventory slot - no other items
        can be exchanged into this slot. Rebecca has her medicine case, while Billy
        has a lighter.<\/p><p>All items and weapons can be examined by the player,
        allowing them to get a closer look and turn the object around. This can sometimes
        change the properties of certain key items, such as unlocking\/opening a key
        item to reveal another inside, or may at least change the title to reflect
        the item''s true identity.<\/p><p>Most items and weapons take up a single
        inventory slot, however there are a select few that require two to carry.
        These are:<\/p><ul><li>Hunting Gun<\/li><li>Shotgun<\/li><li>Grenade Launcher<\/li><li>Hookshot<\/li><li>Rocket
        Launcher<\/li><\/ul><h3>Health &amp; Herbs\/First Aid Sprays<\/h3><p>A character''s
        health can be seen via the inventory menu, with an Electrocardiograph Machine
        showing a character''s status. The different statuses are:<\/p><ul><li><strong>Fine<\/strong>
        - The character is in good health.<\/li><li><strong>Caution<\/strong> - The
        character is roughly at half health.<\/li><li><strong>Danger<\/strong> - The
        character is approaching death.<\/li><li><strong>Poison<\/strong> - The character
        is poisoned and their health will slowly deplete.<\/li><\/ul><p>Besides the
        EKG, players may also note the character''s stance. Whence the characters
        starts holding onto their hip, that is a sign that their health is at least
        in the Caution state, or may even be poisoned.<\/p><p>Carrying the tradition
        set by the original Resident Evil, characters use a small variety of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/medical-herb\/3055-566\"
        data-ref-id=\"3055-566\">herb<\/a>s to heal themselves and cure poisons. Though
        as mentioned before only Rebecca can mix herbs. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/first-aid-spray\/3055-619\"
        data-ref-id=\"3055-619\">First Aid Spray<\/a>s are also available, though
        they only have the singular purpose of healing the character fully. There
        exist three herb types, all of which can be combined in some way for different
        degrees of healing:<\/p><ul><li><b>Green Herb<\/b> - On its own will restore
        25% of health.<\/li><li><b>Blue Herb<\/b> - On its own will cure poison, though
        will not restore any health.<\/li><li><b>Red Herb<\/b> - On its own does nothing.<\/li><li><b>Green
        + Green Herb<\/b> - Mixed will heal the character by roughly 50% of health.<\/li><li><b>Green
        + Green + Green Herb<\/b> - Mixed will heal the character completely, though
        not of any poisons.<\/li><li><b>Green + Blue Herb<\/b> - Mixed will heal the
        character 25% of health and cure any poison.<\/li><li><b>Green + Green + Blue
        Herb<\/b> - Mixed will heal the character 50% of health and cure any poison.<\/li><li><b>Green
        + Red Herb<\/b> - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of
        any poisons.<\/li><li><b>Green + Red + Blue Herb<\/b> - Mixed will heal the
        character completely including poisons.<\/li><li><b>Red + Blue Herb<\/b> -
        Mixed will do nothing.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Saving<\/h3><p>Like every other main
        Resident Evil game pre-Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil Zero requires that players
        find one of the many typewriters located throughout the environments to save,
        and must also have at least one ink ribbon item in their character''s inventory.
        However whereas Save Rooms would always be devoid of enemies in previous games,
        this isn''t the case for Zero.<\/p><p> <\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><h3>Main Characters<\/h3><h4>Rebecca

        they must find a way to restore power to the train and get out of the forest.
        Once, power is finally returned to the locomotive, the train speeds to an
        unknown destination and eventually derails.<\/p><p>Seemingly unscathed from
        the train crash Rebecca and Billy end up at the trains destination. The mansion
        like building, is actually revealed to be a training facility for new employees
        of the <a href=\"\/umbrella-corporation\/3015-204\" data-ref-id=\"3015-204\">Umbrella
        Corporation<\/a>, and upon entering they are welcomed with a pre-recorded
        message from the head of the facility, <a href=\"\/james-marcus\/3005-4575\"
        data-ref-id=\"3005-4575\">James Marcus<\/a>. During their trek through the
        training facility the pair is face with numerous zombies as well as plenty
        of new abominations. Over the course of their time together, Rebecca begins
        to see that Billy isn''t a quite the criminal type, and begins to wonder why
        he was sentenced to be executed. The two eventually discover an underground
        portion of the training facility and are separated when the floor that Rebecca
        is standing on collapses. After being rescued by Billy, she questions him
        about what he did to get the sentence he had been handed. Billy finally explains,
        that he was part of the <a href=\"\/united-states-marine-corps\/3015-2241\"
        data-ref-id=\"3015-2241\">USMC<\/a> (United States Marine Corps) and during
        a mission in Africa, his commanding officer ordered them to exterminate civilians
        of an African village that was suffering from a civil war. Billy refused to
        follow the orders, and once the information proved to be false, the slaughter
        was blamed entirely on him.<\/p><p>Upon entering an abandoned sewage treatment
        plant, the duo encounter James Marcus. Marcus, had been monitoring Coen and
        Chamber''s progress throughout the training facility as well as the other
        areas they visited. Marcus reveals that a decade ago <a href=\"\/ozwell-e-spencer\/3005-10018\"
        data-ref-id=\"3005-10018\">Lord Ozwell E. Spencer<\/a> has Marcus assassinated,
        in the midst of the research on his leech research. He explains that the Queen
        leech from his experiments crawled into his mouth after he was shot, and the
        T-Virus that the leech was injected with was able to resurrect Marcus. Midway
        through his speech, the Queen leech takes over Marcus'' body, and causes him
        to mutate into a new type of leech monstrosity. After toppling the Queen leech,
        Rebecca and Billy escape the training facility just as it is rocked by a gigantic
        explosion. After the escape, Rebecca takes Billy''s dog tags as \"proof\"
        that he didn''t survive the incident, and then the pair amicably part ways.
        In the distance Rebecca is able to see the <a href=\"\/spencer-mansion\/3035-563\"

        staple of the older Resident Evil games, zombies are as prominent as ever
        in Resident Evil Zero. Slow and sluggish in movement, but dangerous up close,
        zombies are durable enough against gunfire that they can prove to be extremely
        dangerous even just in small numbers, especially due to the typically claustrophobic
        environments. When encountered on their own, however, zombies can be dispatched
        relatively easy so long as the player has enough ammunition to spare. As per
        usual, zombies are best dealt with the pistol or sometimes the shotgun, which
        can kill a zombie with a single shot if the player aims directly at its head
        once close enough, or can at least reduce the zombie to a literal crawl by
        destroying its legs.<\/p><p>Zombies attack by grabbing and biting the player
        when close, but will also puke out acid instead if they can''t quite reach
        the player. Some zombies will be encountered lying on the ground, seemingly
        pretending to be dead, and will grab at a character''s leg should the player
        get close enough. However, the leg bite does little damage and will always
        result in the character killing the zombie with a single stomp or kick.<\/p><h3>Cerberus

        hairy spiders, the Web Spinners of Resident Evil 0 appear only briefly within
        the underground levels of the Training Facility. Always encountered in groups,
        they can crawl along walls like any other spider, and will often try to charge
        forward and bite players when given the opportunity. However, their greatest
        weapon is their poison spit, which they will routinely spray; it has a fairly
        long reach of attack and has a high chance of poisoning the player, though
        the base damage it inflicts isn''t quite as alarming.<\/p><p>Web Spinners
        have surprisingly tough hides and are most susceptible to the Grenade Launcher
        - specifically when equipped with flame rounds. They will also often strafe
        once they''ve been shot and attempt to counter the player as such. If a Web
        Spinner is killed with its sack intact, a large multitude of baby spiders
        will seep out of the corpse and attack the player. Though their damage is
        even less than that of a crow and should the player leave the area, they will
        return to find them all gone.<\/p><h3>Eliminator<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\"

        are an infected breed of monkeys that are exceptionally fast and agile, somewhat
        akin to Hunters. However they are also rather small to boot, so should they
        happen to get close enough the player must then aim downwards to get a shot.
        Their main two attacks are to rapidly slash at the player when close, and
        to leap through the air and slash from afar. They are still vulnerable amidst
        their leaping animation, however, providing the player with an opportunity
        to show them down if they can react fast enough. Eliminators are rarely encountered
        alone, and if a group of two to three swarms the player they can prove to
        be highly difficult to escape without taking damage.<\/p><p>Despite their
        small size they''re still rather sturdy. The handgun is outright useless--that
        is besides to potentially finish them off after already being weakened--as
        they shrug the bullets off completely and will continue their advance. As
        such the shotgun and grenade launcher are the most suitable.<\/p><h3>Hunter

        green Alpha variant of the Hunter makes another reprisal to the series, though
        they''re not quite as prominent as they are in the original Resident Evil
        and its remake. They operate identically to how they do in the remake, and
        attack similarly to the Eliminators. They will attack with broad slashes when
        close, but can also perform a mid air leap to attack and also close the distance
        - like the Eliminators also they can be shot out of the air during their leaping
        animation.<\/p><p>They''re rather durable as well, more so than the Eliminators,
        making the shotgun or grenade launcher, if not the magnum--which can kill
        them in one shot--the most appropriate weapons for use.<\/p><h3>Plague Crawler<\/h3><figure

        zombie-like enemy comprised of dozens of leechs. They will usually be of the

        the player with the opportunity to quickly rush past it.<\/p><p>Leech zombies
        are perhaps the most difficult enemy in the game, as their movement speed
        is fast enough to catch up to the player, their regular attacks can be stretched
        out to attack from afar, and their close-range bites deal much more damage
        than that of a regular zombie.<\/p><p>They are also highly resistant to most
        forms of damage - that is besides fire, which will make quick work of them
        should players have any molotovs or flame rounds for the grenade launcher.
        If killed by any other means beyond fire, then the leech zombie will explode,
        dealing a great amount of damage if its radius reaches the characters. It
        will at least begin to convulse and expand as a warning to players that it''s
        about to explode.<\/p><p>Whenever a leech mimic appears it will be accompanied

        on how many leech pieces the player collects upon exiting the facility. If
        one of the character dies then the player''s progress is forfeited. A list
        of the rewards is as such:<\/p><ul><li><strong>0-29<\/strong> - Submachine

        to the remastered version is a new mode called Wesker Mode, which is unlocked
        upon completing the game. In it Billy Coen is replaced by notorious series
        antagonist Albert Wesker, depicted in his <a href=\"\/resident-evil-5\/3030-20569\"
        data-ref-id=\"3030-20569\">Resident Evil 5<\/a> attire. Rebecca is still in
        tow as a fellow protagonist, now wearing a new, darker outfit as well as the
        same type of jewel that allowed Wesker to brainwash <a href=\"\/jill-valentine\/3005-626\"
        data-ref-id=\"3005-626\">Jill Valentine<\/a> into doing his bidding for him
        in Resident Evil 5. While D.C. Douglas returns to provide a few new lines
        of dialogue for telling Rebecca to follow or wait, all of the cutscenes instead
        simply feature Billy''s dialogue coming out of Wesker.<\/p><p>Though mechanically
        speaking Wesker is more than just a simple character skin and has access to
        two unique abilities. First is a super-sprint, to which he can use to effortlessly
        rush past enemies, and the second is a kind of eye blast. The eye blast can
        be charged up for extra power, though even when at its lowest charge can make
        all of the zombies'' heads within the vicinity explode. Rebecca does not gain
        any new abilities of her own, however, and neither character can change into
        any alternate outfits for this mode.<\/p><p>Wesker mode is played within the
        Normal setting.<\/p><h3>DLC Costumes<\/h3><p>RE0''s Remastered version contains
        a number of new purchasable costumes for players to wear in the game. Two
        of which were given for free for preordering the game, while another two were
        awarded for preordering for <a href=\"\/resident-evil-origins-collection\/3030-50713\"
        data-ref-id=\"3030-50713\">Resident Evil: Origins Collection<\/a>. All costumes
        can be bought together as a bundle, however this is the only means by which
        to purchase the preorder outfits, which aren''t sold separately.<\/p><p>None
        of the new costumes are originally designed for RE0, and instead originate
        across a number of classic Capcom games and Resident Evil game ports. A list
        of the new costumes and their origins is as such:<\/p><h3>Rebecca Chambers<\/h3><h4>STARS

        Evil Zero was originally being developed for the generation before the GameCube
        - multiple platforms was planned, though the gameplay footage was shown advertised
        for the Nintendo 64. Development of Resident Evil Zero began in the Summer
        of 1998.<\/p><p>Much of what was developed for the prototype persists in the
        full retail release, such as the two-protagonist setup of Rebecca &amp; Billy,
        it beginning on the Ecliptic Express train, and the death of Edward as he
        leaps through the window. Though there are certain features planned for the
        prototype that never made it into the full game; most notably is how one of
        the two protagonists could die, but the game wouldn''t end unless both Rebecca
        &amp; Billy perish. This idea was scrapped due to how Rebecca canonically
        dying would conflict against her appearance in the original Resident Evil.
        ''Running zombies'' was another idea that was scrapped for RE0, though would
        pave the way for the design of the Crimson Heads in the Resident Evil remake.<\/p><p>During
        development for Zero''s remastered release, Capcom released footage of RE0''s
        prototype version to the public. It was shown to still be using the zombie
        moan fxs from Resident Evil 2, likely due to Resident Evil 2 being ported
        to the N64 years before. Billy''s voice actor is also noted as the same one
        that would voice him in the full release.<\/p><p>Weirdly enough Rebecca is
        also shown to be wearing a beret, which is more so recognizable as the iconic
        hat of choice for Jill Valentine in her STARS uniform. There also exists concept
        art of Rebecca wearing a beret as well, despite the fact that she has never
        been depicted wearing such an item before in the series. Though it''s possible
        that she was to lose the beret during the events of RE0. Nonetheless, she
        was once again designed to be beret-less for the full GameCube release.<\/p>","expected_release_day":null,"expected_release_month":null,"expected_release_quarter":null,"expected_release_year":null,"id":10247,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/8\/82063\/2566511-re0.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/82063\/2566511-re0.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/8\/82063\/2566511-re0.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/82063\/2566511-re0.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/8\/82063\/2566511-re0.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/8\/82063\/2566511-re0.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/8\/82063\/2566511-re0.jpg"},"name":"Resident

        of May 2013.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>Resident Evil: Revelations is a third-person
        action game. Like in other games in the franchise, players must shoot their
        way through hordes of hideously mutated creatures while solving puzzles. Much
        like <a href=\"\/resident-evil-the-mercenaries-3d\/3030-32811\" data-ref-id=\"3030-32811\">Resident
        Evil: The Mercenaries 3D<\/a> before it (and first introduced within the series
        via <a href=\"\/resident-evil-outbreak-file-2\/3030-15222\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15222\">Resident
        Evil: Outbreak - File #2<\/a>), players can shoot and move at the same time,
        and can even switch between both first and third-person views (the 3DS gyroscope
        can also be used for aiming). The trusty knife can also now be instantaneously
        brought out for an attack with the press of a button, rather than requiring
        the player to aim first.<\/p><p>The game uses the touchscreen for solving
        puzzles, and can also be used to heal via a herb. As shown at E3 2011, the
        touchscreen has players unscrewing bolts on control panels, which then leads
        to a puzzle involving covering electric nodes.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><figure

        Evil 5<\/a> (and one year before the events of the Lost in Nightmares DLC
        story), Resident Evil: Revelations puts Chris Redfield and his long-time friend
        and colleague Jill Valentine, founders of the <a href=\"\/bioterrorism-security-assessment-alliance\/3015-2649\"
        data-ref-id=\"3015-2649\">Bio-terrorism Security Assessment Alliance<\/a>
        (BSAA), on a mission to the Cruiser Ship, Queen Zenobia, and then to Europe.<\/p><h2>Raid
        Mode<\/h2><h3>Overview<\/h3><p>Similar in scope to the Mercenaries minigame
        from prior Resident Evil games, Raid mode splits the single-player campaign
        into 20 stages. Though while there''s no actual story, players will ultimately
        traverse all of the environments from the game throughout the mode, as well
        as combat against all of the enemies and bosses.<\/p><p>Unlike Mercenaries
        there is no timer, and each stage has a set beginning and end. The goal is
        to reach from one end to the next, while killing as many enemies as possible
        along the way. The route is usually pretty straightforward, though players
        will sometimes have to kill all enemies within an area to proceed, or will
        have to locate a key, and sometimes both.<\/p><p>What''s notable about this
        mode is it features light RPG mechanics similar to that of an action-RPG.
        Players will level up with experience upon completing levels, numbers will
        bounce off of enemies whence attacked, and there is a loot system in play
        as well complete with a rarity ladder.<\/p><h3>Stage Tiers and Monster Types<\/h3><p>There
        are three different tiers to the stages: Chasm, Trench, and Abyss. Each one
        features the same 20 levels, only they are each more difficult than the last,
        feature higher level monsters, and remixed monster placements in general.
        Some monsters are also tagged as a particular type, which''ll increase certain
        attributes. There are:<\/p><ul><li><strong>Tanks<\/strong>, which increase
        an enemy''s size and overall health significantly. They are noted by the green
        shield next to their health bar.<\/li><li><strong>Rogues<\/strong>, which
        are smaller but incredibly fast, both in movement and attacks, however they
        have less health than the norm. They are noted by the little blue man next
        to their health bar.<\/li><li><strong>Berserkers<\/strong>, which are larger
        but not as large as the Tanks. Instead their primary buff is their overall
        attack damage, which is increased considerably. They are noted by the red
        fist next to their health bar.<\/li><li><strong>Kings<\/strong>, which excel
        in all areas. While they may not be quite as tough, fast, or powerful as each
        of the previous three respectively, they are still highly formidable and are
        extremely dangerous. They are noted by the purple crown next to their health
        bar.<\/li><\/ul><p>Besides the 20 stages for each of the three tiers, there
        is a final level titled Ghost Ship, which spans the entire Queen Zenobia ship
        and is filled with the highest level enemies.<\/p><h3>Weapons &amp; Loot<\/h3><p>The
        majority of the weapons are all taken from the main game, however their stats
        will be randomized, as will their overall capacity to equip modifications.
        There are also four unique Legendary weapons that are exclusive to Raid mode
        and can''t be found anywhere in the main game; these are the Pale Rider magnum,
        the High-Roller assault rifle, the Drake shotgun, and the Murumasa sniper
        rifle. Though these too will be encountered randomly and with different stats
        and levels.<\/p><p>Loot is most commonly acquired by killing difficult enemies,
        or by killing an infected puffer fish (HD version only) during one of its
        scripted appearances amidst the stages. However loot can also be found within
        the stages themselves,<\/p><h3>HUB &amp; Store<\/h3><p>The Raid mode HUB has
        access to all of the mode''s settings and customization options. It allows
        players to select their character, lower their character''s level, select
        the their stage, their weapon-loudout and what mods their weapons are equipped
        with, and has an in-game store available.<\/p><p>The store will randomly sell
        multiple pieces of loot, ranging from weapons, to weapon mods, to items that
        can increase a player''s overall ammo capacity for particular weapons as well
        as their weapon box to store weaponry. Players can also sell any unwanted
        weapons &amp; mods for Battle Points, the mode''s currency.<\/p><p>The store
        will randomize its stock upon each time the player enters. Though players
        can switch between the store and their inventory without having the store
        randomize; this helps should a player have an eye on a particular item, but
        first wants to sell some of their gear so they may better be able to afford
        it.<\/p><h3>Stage Bonuses<\/h3><p>Each stage has a set of bonuses to complete,
        which''ll reward the player with additional experience and Battle Points.
        Completing enough bonuses will also change the color of the player''s username.
        The bonuses are as such:<\/p><ul><li><strong>Low Level Bonus<\/strong> --
        Complete a stage at the recommended level or lower.<\/li><li><strong>Genocide
        Bonus<\/strong> -- Kill every enemy in the stage.<\/li><li><strong>No Damage
        Bonus<\/strong> -- Take no damage during the stage.<\/li><li><strong>Trinity
        Bonus<\/strong> -- Achieve all three of the aforementioned bonuses together
        in one stage.<\/li><li><strong>Perfect Shot Bonus<\/strong> -- Complete a
        stage with 100% accuracy. (3DS version only)<\/li><\/ul><h3>Cooperative Play<\/h3><p>The
        entirety of Raid mode can be played cooperatively for up to 2-players. To
        play in coop, a player could either search for a lobby via a number of criteria,
        or create their own and choose to make it public or private. There are a number
        of tags players can set when making a public lobby, so as to give a brief
        description towards any would-be browsing players what the host has in mind
        for their game. These are:<\/p><ul><li>Welcome All<\/li><li>Casual Play<\/li><li>Please
        Help!<\/li><li>Wanted: Same Level Players<\/li><li>Playing Through<\/li><li>Playing
        for Loot<\/li><li>Wanted: Pros<\/li><li>Beginners Welcome<\/li><li>Going for
        S Rank<\/li><li>Going for Bonuses<\/li><li>No Cheaters<\/li><li>Level 1 Only<\/li><li>Only
        Playing 1 Round<\/li><li>Voice Chatters<\/li><li>Looking for New Friends<\/li><\/ul><p>However
        there is no drop-in drop-out capability; players can only play coop specifically
        under the coop under the Player Match or Private Match settings and with another
        player alongside them in the HUB. When playing in coop the game will not scale
        in anyway and the loot found across the stages is shared, though is also randomized
        between the two players.<\/p><p>Besides traditional headset communication,
        there are a rudimentary set of voice commands that the player can make their
        character express. These are simply Go, Wait, Help, and Thank You, although
        each character has a unique delivery for such commands depending on their
        personality. Parker''s ''Thank You'' line for example is ''''I''m buying you
        lunch''''. Certain pairings of characters will also feature a bit of unique
        dialogue between the two at the start of a stage, such as when pairing together
        Jill and Chris for example.<\/p><h3>3DS Version Characters &amp; Specialities<\/h3><table

        Console\/PC Versions (Unveiled Edition)<\/h2><p>The HD port of Revelations,
        dubbed Unveiled Edition in Japan, comes with support for online co-op in RAID
        Mode, a new higher difficulty (Inferno Mode with different item and enemy
        placements and amounts), new custom parts, new RAID weapons, a new enemy type,
        and two new playable characters in RAID Mode (HUNK and Rachel) along with
        the expected upgrade in visuals as well as Xbox Live Achievements and PSN
        Trophies. Like Resident Evil 6, the Unveiled Edition of Revelations also supports
        <a href=\"\/resident-evilnet\/3015-7553\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7553\">RE.Net<\/a>
        for online events and goodies such as unlockable dioramas of characters and
        monsters, and custom parts and weapons for use in the solo campaign and RAID
        Mode.<\/p><p>However, the laser-sight is no longer available and players must
        now use a standard crosshair to aim. Though the player is at least given a
        choice of color for the crosshair whence an enemy is in the player''s sights
        -- red, blue and green are the colors available.<\/p><h3>Wii U Exclusive Features<\/h3><figure

        data-ref-id=\"3015-4801\">survival horror <\/a>game that was originally released
        in 1998 by <a href=\"\/capcom\/3010-367\" data-ref-id=\"3010-367\">Capcom<\/a>.
        Resident Evil 2 primarily utilizes the same mechanics and gameplay styles
        as the previous <a href=\"\/resident-evil\/3030-5842\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5842\">Resident
        Evil<\/a>, but with updated graphics and a new story set only three months

        aiming up towards an attacking Licker<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The gameplay
        of Resident Evil 2 is virtually the same as the gameplay of the first one,
        and features a mix of combat, exploration, and puzzle solving. Players move
        via a series of<a href=\"\/fixed-camera\/3015-1715\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1715\">
        pre-determined camera angles<\/a> and control their character with ''<a href=\"\/tank-controls\/3015-4647\"
        data-ref-id=\"3015-4647\">tank controls<\/a>'', much like most survival horror
        games of the era. Combat as such is rather rudimentary, as players simply
        aim their weapon with R1 and shoot with X (default PS1 controls). They can
        aim up or down this way as well, though with the assistance of auto-aim (which
        can be turned off) combat is a relatively simple affair. To make up for it,
        however, ammunition is scarce, and thusly forces players to choose between
        whether it''s worth engaging in combat or attempting to flee.<\/p><p>The story
        is largely portrayed via cutscenes, both in-game and CG, however there are
        also a number of Files (diaries, memos ect.) players can collect. These will
        often provide additional insight into the goings on across the overall narrative,
        but some are more vital as they will provide information pertaining to solving
        puzzles or maybe hinting as to where to go next.<\/p><h3>Difficulty Settings<\/h3><p>There
        are two difficulty settings available across most ports of Resident Evil 2
        -- Rookie and Normal. Normal plays much like how the game was intended, whereas
        Rookie lessens enemy health and gifts players some additional handgun ammunition
        and first aid sprays in the item box.<\/p><p>The PC version features a Hard
        difficulty setting, which increases enemy health and damage. The N64 version
        also has available an Arranged mode that mixes all of the items in the game
        around, similar to the mode found in <a href=\"\/resident-evil-directors-cut\/3030-10186\"
        data-ref-id=\"3030-10186\">Resident Evil: Director''s Cut<\/a>.<\/p><h3>Playable
        Characters<\/h3><p>Like the original Resident Evil, there are two playable
        characters to choose from -- <a href=\"\/leon-s-kennedy\/3005-649\" data-ref-id=\"3005-649\">Leon
        S. Kennedy<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/claire-redfield\/3005-628\" data-ref-id=\"3005-628\">Claire
        Redfield<\/a>, sister of <a href=\"\/chris-redfield\/3005-413\" data-ref-id=\"3005-413\">Chris
        Redfield<\/a>. However unlike the original, the two characters do in fact
        coincide and have varying storylines from one another, whereas both Chris
        &amp; Jill''s were essentially the same minus a few details.<\/p><p>Mechanically-speaking
        the two characters are now practically identical to one another. They both
        can withstand the same degree of damage and have the same maximum inventory
        slots. The story itself dictates the differences, as it''ll take each in slightly
        different directions of the <a href=\"\/raccoon-city-police-department\/3035-661\"
        data-ref-id=\"3035-661\">Raccoon Police Department<\/a>, and they each feature
        their own set of unique puzzles to solve, weapons to collect, and characters
        to meet.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10354\/2633569-resident_evil_2_-_ada_wong.jpg\"

        Wong, supporting character amidst Leon''s story<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Leon''s
        story will bring him into contact with femme-fatale, Ada Wong. Claiming to
        be a civilian on the search for her boyfriend, she will provide assistance
        to Leon throughout the game. On two occasions she will follow as an invincible
        AI companion for a short time, armed with a HP browning pistol. Alongside
        being invincible, she has infinite ammo (though must at least reload when
        necessary) and will help kill any enemies the two encounter through their
        travels.<\/p><p>Beyond those sequences, players will also be forced to take
        control of Ada on two occasions for story purposes. She controls exactly like
        Leon and Claire, and has available her HP Browning pistol and a single first
        aid spray. However her weapon stance is different from both characters, and
        it gives her an increase in firing rate with her pistol.<\/p><p>Claire too
        has a playable supporting character, however her''s is the twelve year old
        Sherry Birkin. Like Ada, she too will function both as a friendly NPC and
        as a playable character. However because she is only twelve, she has no means
        of attack available. When following as an NPC, players cannot run off too
        far otherwise Sherry will crouch down and cower, awaiting Claire''s return.
        When standing still Sherry and Claire will hold hands, though they will let
        go once Claire starts moving again.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\"

        character she once again has no means of attack (she does at least have a
        first aid spray) and must attempt to avoid enemies. Though because of her
        small stature, zombies at least will not be able to bite her and will only
        attempt to vomit acid on her instead, which does considerably less damage.
        As well as having no means of attack, Sherry has a slower running speed than
        all the other characters in the game.<\/p><p>For the PS1 version their stories
        are restricted to their own disc--one for Leon, one for Claire--however most

        &amp; Leon coming into contact during Scenarios Leon A \/ Claire B<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Resident
        Evil 2 featured four different scenarios; the first two were labelled as Leon
        A and Claire B scenarios, where Leon entered the police station through the
        front entrance and Claire through the back door. The second two scenarios,
        labelled as Claire A and Leon B, had the roles reversed with the plotline
        slightly altered. Each scenario provided a different experience such as meeting
        with <a href=\"\/robert-kendo\/3005-2520\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2520\">Robert
        Kendo<\/a> and <a href=\"\/marvin-branagh\/3005-18452\" data-ref-id=\"3005-18452\">Marvin

        only have access to Leon &amp; Claire''s A Scenario, though upon completing
        either will then be asked to create a new save slot for the alternate character''s
        B Scenario.<\/p><p>There are a handful of player choices that can carry over
        from A Scenario to B. As either character, they will eventually stumble upon
        a minipack and submachine gun. The A Scenario character can choose to take
        it with them, or they could instead leave it for the B Scenario character
        to collect instead. There is also a room located within the Umbrella Lab near
        the end of the game that requires two hand print IDs to open. As such, it
        can only be opened once both Scenario characters have registered their hand
        print and then placed their hand on the scanner, allowing the B Scenario character
        to its contents.<\/p><p>They are the two most notable crossovers, though there
        are smaller effects as well, such as leaving the zombified Marvin Branagh
        alive in Scenario A, which will then have him continue to persist in the alternate
        character''s B Scenario.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\"

        Claire, and Claire has a lockpick. Though unlike Jill''s capabilities in Resident
        Evil, Claire can only use it to open up locked drawers to acquire some additional
        supplies. Leon must instead locate small keys to open the drawers. Leon will
        also eventually replace his lighter with a G-Virus vial, though it is only
        carried for narrative purposes, serves no mechanical use, and is only temporary
        at that before he throws it away and finds himself with his lighter again.<\/p><p>Supporting
        characters Ada &amp; Sherry each only have a photograph; Ada''s is of her
        and her boyfriend John, while Sherry''s is of her and her parents, William
        and Annette Birkin. The photographs serve no mechanical use, however.<\/p><p>There
        are certain weapons that will take up 2 slots as opposed to one like everything
        else. These are:<\/p><ul><li>Submachine gun<\/li><li>Flamethrower<\/li><li>Spark
        Shot<\/li><li>Gatling Gun<\/li><li>Rocket Launcher<\/li><\/ul><p>Besides the
        character''s inventory, there also exist a number of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/item-box\/3055-6126\"
        data-ref-id=\"3055-6126\">item boxes<\/a> where players can store unwanted
        items. Item boxes are often located within save rooms (though not always)
        and items will persist throughout all item boxes across the game.<\/p><h3>Health
        &amp; Herbs\/First Aid Sprays<\/h3><p>A character''s health can be seen via
        the inventory menu, with an Electrocardiograph Machine showing a character''s
        status. The different statuses are:<\/p><ul><li><strong>Fine (Green)<\/strong>
        - The character is in good health.<\/li><li><strong>Caution (Yellow)<\/strong>
        - The character is roughly at half health.<\/li><li><strong>Danger (Red)<\/strong>
        - The character is approaching death.<\/li><li><strong>Poison (Purple)<\/strong>
        - The character is poisoned and their health will slowly deplete.<\/li><\/ul><p>Besides
        the EKG, players may also note the character''s stance. If a character is
        in the Caution zone, they''ll hold their chest, but move at the same speed
        as if they were perfectly fine. On the other hand if they''re in the Danger
        zone they''ll hold their chest and limp, moving incredibly slower than before.<\/p><p>Carrying
        the tradition set by the original Resident Evil, characters use a small variety
        of <a href=\"\/medical-herb\/3055-566\" data-ref-id=\"3055-566\">herb<\/a>s
        to heal themselves and cure poisons. <a href=\"\/first-aid-spray\/3055-619\"
        data-ref-id=\"3055-619\">First Aid Spray<\/a>s are also available, though
        they only have the singular purpose of healing the character fully. There
        exist three herb types, all of which can be combined in some way for different
        degrees of healing:<\/p><ul><li><b>Green Herb<\/b> - On its own will restore
        25% of health.<\/li><li><b>Blue Herb<\/b> - On its own will cure poison, though
        will not restore any health.<\/li><li><b>Red Herb<\/b> - On its own does nothing.<\/li><li><b>Green
        + Green Herb<\/b> - Mixed will heal the character by roughly 50% of health.<\/li><li><b>Green
        + Green + Green Herb<\/b> - Mixed will heal the character completely, though
        not of any poisons.<\/li><li><b>Green + Blue Herb<\/b> - Mixed will heal the
        character 25% of health and cure any poison.<\/li><li><b>Green + Green + Blue
        Herb<\/b> - Mixed will heal the character 50% of health and cure any poison.<\/li><li><b>Green
        + Red Herb<\/b> - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of
        any poisons.<\/li><li><b>Green + Red + Blue Herb<\/b> - Mixed will heal the
        character completely including poisons.<\/li><li><b>Red + Blue Herb<\/b> -
        Mixed will do nothing.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Saving<\/h3><p>Like the original, Resident
        Evil 2 requires that players find one of the many typewriters located throughout
        the environments to save, and must also have at least one ink ribbon item
        in their character''s inventory.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><h3>Main Characters<\/h3><h4><a

        her exploration of the precinct. Upon the STARS office, she finds Chris''

        the Umbrella Corporation. When exiting the office, she encounters a small
        girl; the girl then reactively runs away out of fear. Claire gives chase but
        loses her, though is also then reunited with Leon in the nearby corridor,
        who hands her a radio so they can better keep in touch. While disheartened
        by the discovery that Chris isn''t in Raccoon City, Leon states that they

        who Claire finally manages to corner. Claire reassures her that she''s not
        a zombie and merely wants to help. The little girl says her name is Sherry.
        After the brief introduction, Sherry states that she is looking for her parents
        and that there''s more than just zombies roaming throughout the station. A
        load roar can be heard, which startles Sherry and forces her to run away again.
        Claire then heads back to Irons'' office, only to find both he and the corpse
        gone. His diary is left on his desk chair; reading it reveals Irons'' sordid
        activities involving hunting and trapping other police officers, as well as
        his involvement with the Umbrella Corporation. Behind his desk is a strange
        puzzle requiring three square stones to be placed.<\/p><p>Heading deeper into

        Sherry to wait in the office while she climbs down the ladder. Claire is then
        held at gunpoint by Irons'', who explains his frustration that Umbrella have
        destroyed his ''''beautiful town'''' and his involvement with the company.
        He also lets loose that the creator of the G-Virus, William Birkin, is the
        father of Sherry. Noticing that he''s at his rope''s end and believes he''s
        going to die, he decides that he''s going to take Claire with him.<\/p><figure

        apart by a parasitic larvae. Heading down the ladder leading towards the sewers,
        the larvae then begins to grow into a large, humanoid monster. Claire is able
        to best the creature and it ultimately disintegrates. Returning to Sherry,
        the two continue through the sewers; Claire also radios Leon that Brian Irons''
        office is accessible, and thet she''s heading to the sewers with Sherry. However
        Sherry is once again forced to split-up with Claire as she accidentally falls
        down a drainage gate. On her own, Sherry explores throughout the sewers, but
        falls down into a large garbage pile and falls unconscience as she limply
        calls for Claire. A large, monstrous creature then appears and infects Sherry
        with a parasitic larvae.<\/p><p>Amidst Claire''s search for Sherry, she encounters
        her mother, Annette Birkin. While holding Claire at gunpoint, Annette explains
        Umbrella''s betrayal of she and her husband William Birkin, and how William
        injected himself with his own G-Virus after an attack on his life by <a href=\"\/umbrella-security-service\/3015-7100\"
        data-ref-id=\"3015-7100\">Umbrella Security Service<\/a> agents. The G-Virus

        claims that William is likely searching for their daughter Sherry, the two
        split-up to find her first. Claire manages to locate Sherry unconscience on
        the garbage pile, however she must first fight her way past a giant alligator.
        Once that''s done, she helps Sherry up, both of whom are unaware of Sherry''s
        larvae infection.<\/p><p>The two continue onward, finally managing to escape
        out of the sewers and coming upon a hidden Umbrella factory. There the two
        board a stationary tram as it heads downwards, taking the two to an Umbrella
        Laboratory. However as the tram descends, Sherry starts to feel sick and passes
        out. Furthermore, a large claw strikes through the tram only just missing
        Sherry. Claire leaves Sherry in the tram while she investigates outside.<\/p><p>Upon
        investigating the tram platform, the monstrous William Birkin jumps from atop
        the tram after further mutating. Claire does battle with the monster and is
        able to force him to collapse and bleed out. The tram then arrives at its
        destination; from there Claire takes Sherry to the receptionist office of
        the lab. Giving Sherry her biker jacket ''''for protection'''', Claire leaves
        Sherry in the office while she goes on to explore the lab.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\"

        what used to be her husband, but is viciously murdered by him. Claire is able
        to locate a file detailing the creation of the cure Sherry needs. Entering
        William''s own lab, she is able to create the cure to eliminate the infection.
        With the cure in hand, the self-destruct mechanism also goes into motion.
        Unlocking all doors, this also opens up the emergency exit. After radioing
        Leon to bring Sherry to the emergency exit, Claire goes on the move to meet
        them.<\/p><p>After locating the elevator that''ll take her down to the escape
        train, William Birkin bursts through the wall above and mutates even further.
        Now taking the form of a kind of huge canine creature, it attacks Claire.
        With a five minute timer ticking down, Claire is once again able to defend
        herself against Birkin. As it begins to decompose, Claire boards the elevator.
        The train has already begun to move, with Leon shouting for Claire to jump

        complies, and allows Ada to go off on her own. Upon entering through the crawlspace
        she encounters a small girl. The surprise forces the girl to drop her pendant

        She chases after her but the scientist begins firing; Leon then quickly dives
        in front of Ada, while being shot in the process. He falls unconscience while

        T-103 Tyrant advancing unto Leon<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>After discovering
        that the woman she is talking to is Ada Wong, she coldly states that her boyfriend
        John is dead and became a zombie. Being aware of her true intentions, Annette
        then attempts to kill Ada; the two engage in a struggle, with Ada slapping
        Annette forcing her to fall over the edge of the railing. Ada attempts to
        grab her hand, but to no avail and sarcastically responds with ''''too bad''''.<\/p><p>Leon
        manages to wake up and goes after Ada despite his injuries. Finding her nearby
        to where she fought with Annette, she thanks Leon for his bravery in saving
        her from being shot and patches up his bullet wound. She also shares with
        him her discovery of John''s fate, and asks that they get out of here.<\/p><p>The
        two continue through the sewers until locating a tram, which takes them toward
        an abandoned Umbrella factory. There they encounter another tram, only this
        one stays motionless on a platform that descends down to Umbrella'' secret
        laboratory. However as it descends, William Birkin attacks the two. He first
        strikes through the tram''s wall, managing to graze Ada and knocking her out.
        Leon then heads outside and does battle with William and is once more able
        to defeat him.<\/p><p>Returning to the tram Ada has awoken, although the tram
        has stopped midway and hasn''t managed to reach the lab. Leon suggests that
        Ada should stay and rest while he looks for a way to kickstart the tram. After
        climbing through the vents, however, the tram inconveniently begins to work
        and continues its descent with Ada still inside. With no other alternative
        but to make his way down, Leon is able to restore power to the area and the
        nearby elevator, and use it to reach the lab. Noticing the tram, Leon enters
        but finds that Ada has disappeared.<\/p><p>Leon will eventually come into
        contact with Annette Birkin, who while holding him at gunpoint states that
        Ada is in fact a spy and is trying to acquire the G-Virus. Leon doesn''t believe
        her, though Annette doesn''t seem to care either way as she then prepares
        to kill him. Just before she pulls the trigger, the T-103 tyrant arrives on
        the scene, forcing Annette to run away. Leon is able to once again deal enough
        damage to temporarily down the creature, and tries to find Ada.<\/p><figure

        &amp; Leon''s embrace<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Heading towards the power
        room, Leon is again ambushed by the T-103 tyrant. Only this time Ada arrives
        for assistance and tries to gain its attention to save Leon. The tyrant does
        so and grabs her; Ada manages to shoot it in the face, however, forcing it
        to toss Ada away at a large machine console before it accidentally falls into
        a vat of molten liquid below.<\/p><p>The collision between Ada and the machine
        dealt enough damage that it instigated the self-destruct sequence. Leon rushes
        to Ada, who appears to be dying, and the two share an intimate kiss before
        she bleeds out.<\/p><p>Leon soon receives a radio call from Claire, asking
        him to retrieve Sherry from the receptionist office. He does so, and takes
        the elevator down to the emergency escape train, which has become accessible
        due to the self-destruct sequence. He lets Sherry rest on the tram and then
        heads back out to turn on the power. Upon doing so, however, the T-103 tyrant
        arrives, having gone through a severe mutation that has given it two large
        claws and made to be much more aggressive. The battle occurs in the midst
        of a five minute timer, with Leon just barely able to defend himself until
        a silhouette of what looks to be Ada drops him a rocket launcher.<\/p><p>Leon
        picks up the rocket launcher and fires it at the tyrant, destroying it completely.
        Making his return to the train now that it is powered, he turns on the train.
        As it begins to pick up speed, Claire arrives and jumps onto the train just
        in the nick of time. She quickly administers a cure for Sherry, who was infected
        by William, which appears to take effect and heal her. With the ordeal behind
        them, Leon heads to the driver''s compartment and says his goodbye to Ada.<\/p><p>However
        the train quickly rumbles as an alarm sounds. Leon heads back to Claire and
        Sherry asking what''s going on, and heads to investigate the other compartments.
        Reaching the very end of the train, William Birkin--now an amorphous blob--pours
        onto the train and slowly slithers towards Leon. With the door locked behind
        him as a precautionary measure put into effect by the train, Leon is forced
        to unload everything he has into the monster. After enough punishment it begins
        to disintegrate, as the door also conveniently unlocks behind Leon.<\/p><figure

        Birkin''s final form<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>While on his way to return
        to Claire, William Birkin strikes back into action, forcing all three characters
        to split-up. Claire is left hanging off the bottom of the train, Leon crawls
        across the top, and Sherry rushes to the driver''s compartment. Leon is then
        able to reach the driver''s compartment and tell Sherry to turn on the emergency
        brake. She does so, allowing the three to reunite and quickly run out of the
        tunnel before the train self-destructs.<\/p><p>With the nightmare finally
        over with, the three rest their weary legs. But only before Claire rises up
        again and states that she still has to find her brother Chris.<\/p><h4>Epilogue<\/h4><p>As
        first detailed in Claire''s unlockable epilogue file in Resident Evil 3: Nemesis,
        Leon opposes Claire''s idea to quickly rush into action so soon to find her
        brother. Insulted that she opts to abandon them for the sake of her brother,
        Leon tells her to go and that they [Leon &amp; Sherry] don''t need her help.
        Claire understands that they require medical attention, yet sets out anyway,
        while promising that she''ll return one day.<\/p><h3>Alternate Scenarios<\/h3><p>While
        Claire A &amp; Leon B is the canon ordering, players can still alternatively
        play through the opposite sequence, where Leon in fact heads through the entrance
        and Claire enters from the back. This then switched certain character roles,
        such as Claire coming into conflict with the T-103 Tyrant, and Leon encountering
        the characters of Robert Kendo and Marvin Branagh. Though the results are
        the same, there are certain character fates that differ slightly during this
        ordering of the Scenarios:<\/p><h4>Leon A<\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\"

        starting weapon for both Leon &amp; Claire, the knife is traditionally a last
        resort tactic and even then the player should probably choose to run away

        may often accidentally have it collide with the scenery leaving the player
        vulnerable for a second.<\/p><p>Leon &amp; Claire each use the knife differently,
        with Leon choosing to jab it as opposed to Claire''s swipe -- which may have

        crawl towards the player. Players will commonly first encounter the shotgun

        the locker of the S.T.A.R.S. office. This is so players can still collect

        advanced mutation of zombies, mostly recognizable for their long tongue and
        claws. Lickers are extremely agile and fast, have an attack that can commit
        an instant-kill against the player, and can withstand more damage than the
        typical zombie. Lickers also have the added advantage of being able to climb
        up and rest upon flat surfaces, including ceilings. However they often tend
        to make a breathy growl of sorts, that along with the squishy noise of their
        movements makes them easy to pick up should one be close by.<\/p><p>A licker
        usually takes between 2-3 shotgun or crossbow attacks to kill one. Though
        because of their lack of sight, players can potentially avoid encounters with
        one should they walk past rather than run. However if a player gets close
        enough, a Licker will always catch on to their presence and give chase regardless
        of their movement speed. While they can sometimes be encountered alone, they
        will more often than not be found in groups of at least two.<\/p><p>Their
        attacks often involve their claws; they will swipe the player''s leg when
        close, and when encountered at a distance will give off a loud shriek and
        then leap through the air in an attempt to maul the player. They will alternatively
        strike with their tongue and attempt to strangle the player; if the player''s
        health is in the Caution state, there''s a high chance the Licker will rip
        off the player''s head completely.<\/p><h3>Evolved Licker<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\"

        is slow in speed, so its primary source of attack is to vomit out several
        small larvae to then seek out the player and attempt to force themselves down
        their throat. Otherwise it can punch the character when close enough, but
        the primary tactic is to keep a good distance and keep shooting at it, while

        tunnel; its size means it is impossible to run past it. There are two methods
        to killing it: first is the basic path of simply unloading whatever the player
        has into the creature; alternatively the player could drop the gas canister
        that resides within the middle of the tunnel, and then shoot it once the alligator
        picks it up with its mouth killing it instantly. If players choose to kill
        it the old fashioned way, there will be a small stash of ammunition awaiting
        them next to the tram later in the game.<\/p><p>The alligator will always
        be fought in Scenario A, however if it is killed via the gas canister it will
        stay dead for the alternate character''s Scenario B. Otherwise it must be
        fought again in much the same way, complete with the gas canister still available;
        it will also visually be shown wounded to account for the previous battle.<\/p><h3>T-103

        from around a corner. A clear way to note if it is about to arrive is if the
        theme music for the area has stopped.<\/p><p>It is usually designed to block
        the player from progressing, forcing them to kill it before it reaches them.
        Though it will always walk, and when attacked with a powerful enough weapon
        such as a shotgun will slow down even further. If it gets close its attacks
        will do a noticeable amount of damage and can potentially kill the player
        with only about 4 attacks. It will only use its fists to attack, usually using
        a hook punch to knock the player back as a method of again forcing players
        to fight it. Though it will also sometimes do an overhead smash with both
        hands clasped together -- its most powerful attack.<\/p><p>After enough damage

        simply brute force their way through the fight and hope they have enough healing
        supplies. Upon enough damage, from around 4-5 upgraded magnum shots for reference,
        a silhouette of Ada Wong will arrive to drop the player--as either Leon or
        Claire--a rocket launcher.<\/p><p>The player must then quickly rush and equip

        primarily swing the pipe around randomly -- any attack that hits does a significant
        amount of damage, however. Similar to G, the primary strategy is to keep at
        a distance and fire whatever the player has. He can withstand a fair amount
        of damage, roughly taking about eight grenade rounds. Once enough damage has

        form is the point where Birkin now literally begins to shed his human qualities
        in favor of something more monstrous, and is the first William boss for Scenario
        A. After discarding his pipe, his right arm has grown into an enormous claw,
        now making him somewhat resemble a tyrant.<\/p><p>The battleground is set
        on a tram platform descending down into Umbrella''s underground laboratory.
        Birkin still only walks, but the arena is of a U shape, with the possibility
        of the player finding themselves at a dead end. Though area is also wide enough
        that players should be able to potentially rush past.<\/p><p>Birkin of course
        now attacks with his claw, which has a slightly greater reach than the pipe
        but roughly does the same amount of damage. He will also take about the same
        amount of damage to down as before, so as long as players again keep their
        distance he will eventually begin bleeding and ultimately slump to the floor
        after receiving enough damage.<\/p><h3>William Birkin Third Form<\/h3><figure

        this point William now resembles something more demonic than human, and has
        access to two equally large claws protruding from his shoulders along with
        what is now another pair of claws that were once his hands. This form is fought
        in the B Scenario on the same tram platform as his previous form was fought.<\/p><p>He
        still only walks but each step will now cover more distance, allowing him
        to more quickly catch up to the player. His attacks also now have a much larger
        reach than before, and he will periodically enter a stance with all four of
        his claws raised up. If attacked amidst this stance he will unleash a powerful
        combo with all four claws and can potentially kill the player outright with
        this attack. If he isn''t able to strike the player with this attack, after
        so long he will revert back to his default stance<\/p><p>This form is naturally
        tougher than the last and can withstand even more damage. Though this time
        when the battle is over Birkin will leap away onto the wall rather than pass
        out.<\/p><h3>William Birkin Fourth Form<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\"

        final boss of Scenario A, Birkin has how transformed into some sort of monstrous
        canine. His shoulder claws have morphed into his front legs, and he has grown
        considerably in mass with a large maw for a mouth.<\/p><p>Now running on four
        ''legs'', this form is his fastest by a great deal, and he will commonly rush
        at the player and grab them with its maw and shake the player around like
        a ragdoll. It won''t kill the player outright but still does a high amount
        of damage.<\/p><p>The arena offers two tall series of tubes, to which Birkin
        will occasionally jump onto, potentially allowing players some temporary safety
        and to get in some extra shots. Though it will eventually jump off and may
        also attack the player simultaneously.<\/p><p>In traditional Resident Evil
        fashion, there is a 5 minute timer ticking down during the battle.<\/p><h3>William

        final boss of Scenario B, William has ultimately become an amorphous blob
        of a creature, made up of a variety of eyes, teeth, claws, and assimilated
        corpses all over. Probably the simplest boss in the game, it exists more for
        spectacle than to serve as a challenge. Set on the cargo cart of the escape
        train, the player is trapped between a locked door and the slowly slithering
        horror that is now William Birkin.<\/p><p>The player is simply tasking with
        unloading whatever they have into it from their position. At this point players
        should have access to a single shot left for their rocket launcher which,
        while it won''t kill Birkin, will deal a fair bit of damage. After so much
        punishment Birkin begins to decompose, while the door conveniently unlocks
        behind the player allowing them to escape. Upon opening the door the game
        will end, switching to a CG cutscene showcasing Birkin''s ultimate demise
        due to the self-destruction of the train -- after the characters themselves
        have escaped.<\/p><h2>Unlockables<\/h2><p>Like most Resident Evil games, Resident

        attain an S rank the player must complete the game under 2 hours, without
        using any first aid sprays and only saving once. Upon achieving an S rank,
        or even A rank, for both scenarios, the player will be rewarded with a submachine
        gun, a gatling gun, and a rocket launcher, all with infinite ammo, but only
        for the completed scenario pair. They will be awaiting in the item box should

        players as H.U.N.K. to make it to the RPD helipad for extraction. However
        H.U.N.K.s supplies are limited, and no more can be found amidst the story.
        Furthermore, all of the enemies from the main game make an appearance, including
        two appearances of the Mr. X tyrant.<\/p><p>H.U.N.K.s inventory is as such:<\/p><ul><li>H&amp;K

        players are to choose wisely as to what to use against what enemies, as there
        are many more enemies in the player''s path than they have bullets. Upon reaching
        the helipad it shows H.U.N.K. signalling for his escape chopper and flying
        away. In all ports from the Dualshock version onward, a timer will tick up
        showing how long it took the player to finish.<\/p><p>The mini-story''s title
        is somewhat inconsistent with the amount of characters whom actually survive,
        with Leon, Claire, Sherry, and Ada also eventually being revealed to have

        of Tofu only but has a combat knife to defend itself with. It does also have
        some additional herbs, however, and it is noticeably sturdier than the other
        characters in the game. Nonetheless, The Tofu Survivor is arguably the toughest
        minigame in the main Resident Evil series.<\/p><p>Because of the lack of reliable
        weaponry on hand, players are to instead attempt to avoid most encounters,
        using such tactics as the fan-coined ''''wall hug'''' of running diagonally
        into a wall to attempt to pass enemies. Completing the minigame yields the
        same ending as The 4th Survivor, and this too features a timer to help clock
        how long it took players to complete from the Dualshock version onward.<\/p><p>The
        mode itself originated as a joke by the developers, after they would use the
        Tofu character model to help in designing collision detection.<\/p><h3>Extreme

        Differences<\/h2><h3>Resident Evil 2 (<a href=\"\/playstation\/3045-22\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">Sony
        PlayStation<\/a>)<\/h3><p>The original version of Resident Evil 2 released
        on January 21, 1998 in North America. One week later, Biohazard 2 would be
        released in Japan. The content was spread across two discs and featured considerable
        improvements to the mechanics and graphics from the preceding <a href=\"\/resident-evil\/3030-5842\"
        data-ref-id=\"3030-5842\">Resident Evil<\/a> (see \"Gameplay\" section above).<\/p><p>Supposedly,
        the Japanese release was considerably easier than its North American counterpart,
        featuring different item placement, better firepower and auto-aim enabled
        by default. Additionally, the Japanese version did not include scenes of player
        characters being eaten by zombies after death and gore was diminished along
        with some violent depictions.<\/p><h3>Resident Evil 2: DualShock Version (Sony
        PlayStation)<\/h3><p>Virtually the same as the original PlayStation version,
        but with added functionality to accept the <a href=\"\/dualshock-controller\/3000-1\"
        data-ref-id=\"3000-1\">DualShock Controller<\/a> released after the game''s
        original release date. The game featured vibration functions and analog controls.
        This release also saw the addition of Extreme Battle, an unlockable mini game
        where the player needs to reach the police station and find four anti-biohazard
        bombs. Also, a cheat code for unlimited ammo was added.<\/p><p>The Japanese
        DualShock version featured a \"USA Version\" mode, bringing the difficulty
        up to par with its overseas counterpart; this release also had feature parity
        with the North American version and sported the same add-ons and DualShock-only
        functions. The violence scenarios and gore, however, still remained censored,
        edited or omitted.<\/p><p>In 2009, the DualShock Version was released on the
        <a href=\"\/playstation-network-ps3\/3045-88\" data-ref-id=\"3045-88\">PlayStation
        Store<\/a> at a $5.99 price point and is compatible with both the PlayStation
        3 and PSP.<\/p><h3>Resident Evil 2 Platinum (Windows ''98 <a href=\"\/pc\/3045-94\"
        data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC<\/a>)<\/h3><p>Contained the same content as the
        PlayStation releases, except the Dualshock Version''s mini games were unlocked
        from the start. The game was spread across two CD-ROMs.<\/p><h3>Resident Evil
        2 (<a href=\"\/nintendo-64\/3045-43\" data-ref-id=\"3045-43\">Nintendo 64<\/a>)<\/h3><p>After
        commercial success on the PlayStation, Capcom commissioned <a href=\"\/angel-studios\/3010-1195\"
        data-ref-id=\"3010-1195\">Angel Studios<\/a> (later renamed to <a href=\"\/rockstar-san-diego\/3010-3339\"
        data-ref-id=\"3010-3339\">Rockstar San Diego<\/a>) to create an Nintendo 64
        port. The PlayStation original, however, had over 700MB of data spread across
        its two discs and the highest capacity for a Nintendo 64 cartridge was a comparatively
        tiny 64MB (512 Mbit). Despite the software media limitations, the N64 port
        was comparable to the PlayStation version with the omission of the DualShock
        Version''s Extreme Battle mini game. This version also added additional documents
        called EX files, which referenced numerous plot details and <a href=\"\/resident-evil-zero\/3030-10247\"
        data-ref-id=\"3030-10247\">Resident Evil Zero<\/a>, which at that time was
        still in development for the N64 before being moved over to the GameCube later
        on.<\/p><p>Thanks to the Nintendo 64''s additional 4MB of RAM added by the
        (optional) Expansion Pak, the game displayed at a higher resolution at times,
        switching between 640x480 and 320x240 (the PlayStation version''s native resolution)
        depending on how many enemies were in the area. If the player defeated the
        enemies, then the game would automatically switch to the higher resolution.
        Without the Expansion Pak, the game''s visuals closely resembled the PlayStation
        original.<\/p><p>Audio from this version suffered the most compression despite
        the addition of surround sound (which was absent from previous releases).
        All content fit on one cartridge and did not force players to switch between
        two different pieces of media.<\/p><h3>Biohazard 2 Value Plus (<a href=\"\/dreamcast\/3045-37\"
        data-ref-id=\"3045-37\">Sega Dreamcast<\/a>)<\/h3><p>The Value Plus version
        is a Japanese-exclusive release that came out one year after the DualShock
        version and in the same year as the PC and N64 ports. It was bundled with
        a disc containing a demo of <a href=\"\/resident-evil-code-veronica\/3030-13940\"
        data-ref-id=\"3030-13940\">Resident Evil: Code Veronica<\/a> and assorted
        music from various games in the series. Since the Dreamcast ran on a Windows
        CE operating system, this version of Resident Evil 2 was identical to the
        PC release (see above). However, if the player had a <a href=\"\/vmu-support\/3015-6194\"
        data-ref-id=\"3015-6194\">VMU<\/a>, they could see their character''s health
        on the display.<\/p><h3>Resident Evil 2 (Sega Dreamcast)<\/h3><p>Resident
        Evil 2 on Dreamcast in territories other than Japan is a two-GD ROM set with
        each disc being a campaign for the two characters, similar to the original
        PlayStation edition. The Dreamcast version is known for having no drops in
        the game''s framerate and having higher resolution backgrounds than the Playstation,
        Nintendo 64 and GameCube versions. It also had an \"Extra\" option in the
        main menu that allowed the player to view concept art and in-game cutscenes.
        Like the Japanese version, if the player had a VMU, they were able to see
        their character''s health status on the <a href=\"\/vmu-support\/3015-6194\"
        data-ref-id=\"3015-6194\">VMU<\/a> screen.<\/p><h3>Biohazard 2 PC (Windows
        XP PC)<\/h3><p>The same as the PC version released in 1998, except now compatible
        with Windows XP machines and on one DVD-ROM with uncompressed 640x480 CG scenes.
        This particular version is a Japanese exclusive released in 2006. It''s often
        referred to as BioHazard 2 SourceNext, after after the company responsible
        for re-releasing this version<\/p><h3>Resident Evil 2 (<a href=\"\/gamecube\/3045-23\"
        data-ref-id=\"3045-23\">Nintendo Gamecube<\/a>)<\/h3><p>Some note this as
        the definitive version of Resident Evil 2, and while it does not feature any
        of the EX files on N64, it comes complete with the <em>Extreme<\/em> <i>Battle
        <\/i>minigame. Although it did sport slightly better graphics, background
        resolutions were worse than the Dreamcast and PC versions. Minor differences
        such as the voice on the main menu are present. All content is available on
        one disc.<\/p><p>Along with the release of <a href=\"\/resident-evil-3-nemesis\/3030-5587\"
        data-ref-id=\"3030-5587\">Resident Evil 3: Nemesis<\/a> on the Gamecube, this
        particular version is considered a rarity for the system because of low print
        run.<\/p><h2>Development<\/h2><h3>Resident Evil 1.5<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\"

        of Elza equipped with a shotgun<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>After the launch
        of Resident Evil, work immediately began on Resident Evil 2 and was scheduled
        for a 1997 release. Nearing the end of development, when the game was about
        80-90% done, the creators felt the sequel was more of the same and was scrapped.
        The previous version of the game had a female protagonist named Elza Walker
        who was eventually replaced by Claire Redfield. She shared many of Claire\u2019s
        traits such as being an avid fan of <a href=\"\/motorcycle\/3055-366\" data-ref-id=\"3055-366\">motorbikes<\/a>
        and was a student. While Claire is the sister of the Chris Redfield, the Resident
        Evil 1.5 protagonist, Elza, was completely unrelated to any previous Resident
        Evil character. Leon Kennedy also had a radically different appearance initially,
        but that too was altered since Capcom believed it held too strong a resemblance
        to former Resident Evil hero <a href=\"\/chris-redfield\/3005-413\" data-ref-id=\"3005-413\">Chris
        Redfield<\/a>. Additionally, the policeman named Marvin who dies early on
        in Resident Evil 2 had a much bigger role in this incarnation; supposedly
        he would help the player escape the city similar to the role of <a href=\"\/barry-burton\/3005-987\"
        data-ref-id=\"3005-987\">Barry<\/a> in Resident Evil 3.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\"

        in her original researcher outfit<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Furthermore, the
        design and layout of the police department was modern and resembled a typical
        police structure. It lacked the gothic elements of the final police station
        and used the color gray quite frequently; perhaps in a bid to make the area
        feel sterile. Finally, amongst other things, were the varieties of the monsters.
        Sketches and screenshots showcase zombies of different races, monsters that
        resembled the reapers from <a href=\"\/resident-evil-5\/3030-20569\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20569\">Resident
        Evil 5<\/a> and two bosses, which made the cutting room floor named Zeiram
        and Gorgoda. Zeiram and Gorgoda\u2019s elements of design ultimately were
        used to create <a href=\"\/william-birkin\/3005-3332\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3332\">William
        Birkin<\/a>\u2019s G-form.<\/p><p>The characters had unique and more professional
        animations for wielding weapons, such as Leon holding his gun up when standing
        still rather than continuing in his neutral stance.<\/p><p>A version of the
        game that looks to be almost complete is in the confines of a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.playstationmuseum.org\/\"

        of previously unseen footage posted on Youtube, nothing else has been released,
        much to the dismay of fans.<\/p><p> <\/p><h2>Remake<\/h2><p>On August 12th,
        2015, Capcom announced that they will be proceeding with a Resident Evil 2
        Remake. No major details were provided, but it is presumed that the game will
        receive the same treatment as the Gamecube remake of <a href=\"\/resident-evil\/3030-27715\"

        use of the DS touch screen<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Resident Evil: Deadly
        Silence brings the classic <a href=\"\/survival-horror\/3015-4801\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4801\">survival
        horror<\/a> series to the Nintendo DS. Deadly Silence is an enhanced port
        of the <a href=\"\/resident-evil\/3030-5842\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5842\">PlayStation
        original<\/a>, with two different modes.<\/p><p>The first mode is Classic
        and is exactly the same as the PlayStation original, though certain musical
        themes have been remixed or removed entirely.<\/p><p>Rebirth mode contains
        more enemies and ammo, as well as specific content that utilizes the unique
        functions of the DS, such as touch screen knife fights as well as puzzles
        using the touch screen and microphone for control. This includes giving mouth
        to mouth by blowing into the microphone to help revive <a href=\"\/richard-aiken\/3005-3884\"
        data-ref-id=\"3005-3884\">Richard Aiken<\/a>, to having to turn a valve with
        the touch screen to stop the flow of poisonous water, to even playing a game
        of darts -- again with the use of the touch screen.<\/p><p>Beyond the additional
        puzzles, many new jump scare moments and remixed enemy placements have also
        been put into effect for Rebirth mode as well. Though the plot of the game
        is untouched from the very original Resident Evil, and still includes all
        of the same hallmarks such as the dubious voice performances and dodgy localization
        work. Richard Aiken''s VO was actually redone in Rebirth mode for the sake
        of him providing a hint to one of the game''s new puzzles; that, and there
        are a number of in-game quips regarding the player character''s success concerning
        certain puzzles as well.<\/p><h2>Gameplay and Visual Enhancements<\/h2><p>Even
        for Classic Mode, Deadly Silence is privy to numerous gameplay updates over
        the very original release. The most notable is the inclusion of a 180 degree
        turn by simultaneously pressing down and the run button, first introduced
        in <a href=\"\/resident-evil-3-nemesis\/3030-5587\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5587\">Resident
        Evil 3: Nemesis<\/a>. Furthermore, there is a dedicated button for the character''s
        knife--holding down L will have the player character equip it for use--and
        it thusly no longer needs to be carried in the player''s inventory. Finally,
        players can also prematurely reload their weapons mid-game by pressing Y (default
        controls) when aiming, as opposed to doing it in the inventory or waiting
        until the firearm is out of ammo.<\/p><p>The character models for <a href=\"\/albert-wesker\/3005-627\"
        data-ref-id=\"3005-627\">Albert Wesker <\/a>and <a href=\"\/enrico-marini\/3005-3885\"
        data-ref-id=\"3005-3885\">Enrico Marini<\/a> have been upgraded to take into
        account their revised characters design from the 2002 <a href=\"\/resident-evil\/3030-27715\"
        data-ref-id=\"3030-27715\">Resident Evil remake<\/a>. Certain animations for
        both characters and even enemies--including the T-002 <a href=\"\/tyrant\/3015-8404\"
        data-ref-id=\"3015-8404\">Tyrant<\/a>--have also been touched up (and in some
        cases sped up as well) with additional frames to make them look slightly more
        natural when animating. Many of the item icons in a player character''s inventory
        have been redone, some to reflect the retcons from the remake, such as the
        handgun now being made to resemble the <a href=\"\/samurai-edge\/3055-6137\"
        data-ref-id=\"3055-6137\">Samurai Edge<\/a>.<\/p><p>Certain elements of the
        Director''s Cut version of the game have been carried over, such as both character''s
        ability to score a critical hit against a zombie with the handgun, destroying
        the head completely, and the zombie reanimation of STARS Bravo member <a href=\"\/forest-speyer\/3005-4246\"
        data-ref-id=\"3005-4246\">Forest Speyer.<\/a><\/p><p>Due to the benefit of
        a dual-screen, the map of the area is now permanently available for view on
        the top screen, alongside a visual indicator for the player character''s health.
        So should a character''s health fall into a lesser state, such as Caution,
        the upper screen will begin to flash orange to indicate as such.<\/p><h2>New

        ''Yawn'' from the main game.<\/p><p>Both Chris and Jill are once again selectable,
        with Chris being the harder of the two.<\/p><h3>Multi-Card Multiplayer<\/h3><p>In
        addition, there is a local-only multiplayer mode for up to 4 players that
        involves getting from one end of the level to another either as a team or
        competitively, with multiple members of STARS playable and 3 maps to play
        on. One notable downside, however, is that the other players are invisible
        whenst playing the mode and are instead represented by colored stars on the
        map.<\/p><p>All of the STARS members encountered in the game--including some
        simply as corpses--are available to play as, however besides Chris &amp; Jill
        they must all be unlocked by certain means. Each character has their own unique

        new costumes to wear. Alongside the original unlockable costume, both characters
        have available an additional outfit to wear exclusive to this version of the
        game. However the new costume is only available to change into in Rebirth

        Veronica is notable for featuring 3D environments as opposed to pre-rendered<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Much
        like previous main Resident Evil entries, Code: Veronica mixes in third-person
        combat, exploration and puzzle solving. Code: Veronica only has the one storyline,
        like Resident Evil 3: Nemesis before it.<\/p><p>The combat continues to confine
        the player to the ground when firing their weapon, and the notorious tank
        controls are still in effect. Players must also once again move via a series
        of pre-determined camera angles, though auto-aim is turned on by default,
        allowing players a means to note if there are enemies outside of their vision.
        Simultaneously pressing down and the ''run'' button will have the player character
        perform an immediate 180 degree turn.<\/p><p>Code: Veronica marks the first
        time that the series enters into full 3D, with the environments now being
        made up of polygons as opposed to the pre-rendered backgrounds of old. Veronica
        is also much lengthier than previous games on average, to perhaps account
        for its single storyline.<\/p><p>Despite being the fourth game in the series
        and released after Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, Veronica ended up making a few
        steps back in terms of available mechanics and features. Nearly all of the
        updates brought about from Resident Evil 3 aren''t apart of the game--because
        they were both developed at the same time causing a dissonance between the
        two--such as players being able to create their own ammo, live-selection choices,
        and the dodge maneuver. Though destructible barrels still persist and can
        be shot to deal a great degree of damage to any nearby enemies - including
        the player too if they''re within range of the explosion.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\"

        are a couple of dual-wielding firearms available to wield in the game<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Though
        what''s especially notable is the fact that walking up\/down staircases is
        once again automated and can''t be performed manually. Zombies, however, can
        freely walk up\/down staircases at will, which will also result in the player
        having to wait for it to make its ascent\/descent before they can then use
        the staircase themselves.<\/p><p>Gore has been slightly toned down. Zombies
        heads no longer have the capability to explode like in previous Resident Evils,
        nor can their limbs fall off. When shot with a magnum, or a close-range shotgun
        blast to the head, the zombie''s head would gush out blood but still stay
        intact.<\/p><h3>Playable Characters<\/h3><p>While only featuring the one selectable
        story, Veronica still includes two main playable characters. For the first
        half of the game players take up the role of Claire Redfield, then by the
        second will play as her brother, Chris Redfield. Both Redfields control the
        exact same and there are no mechanical or statistical differences between
        the two.<\/p><p>During a short period of Chris''s portion, players will temporarily
        return to the role of Claire. Supporting character Steve Burnside will also
        be controlled for an extremely brief time while he tests out his new dual
        submachine guns, though he too plays identical to Claire &amp; Chris.<\/p><h3>Inventory<\/h3><figure

        characters across the game carry the same inventory space of eight slots (to
        which can be eventually increased to ten), along with a ninth\/eleventh slot
        that can equip a unique item. This can either be a lighter, to which is what
        Claire finds first, or a lockpick that she can attain later on in exchange
        for the lighter. If Claire receives the lockpick, Chris Redfield will then
        be able to receive the lighter for his part of the game. If she does not then
        Chris will gain the lockpick. Steve Birkin''s unique item is a photograph
        of he and his parents.<\/p><p>The lighter can be equipped like a weapon, though
        while it has no means of attack it can help illuminate the area, as well as
        ward away any bats. It also gives Chris access to the dual submachine guns.
        The lockpick can be used to unlock a number of drawers and lockers for additional
        supplies.<\/p><p>All items and weapons can be examined by the player, allowing
        them to get a closer look and turn the object around. This can sometimes change
        the properties of certain key items, such as unlocking\/opening a key item
        to reveal another inside, or may at least change the title to reflect the
        item''s true identity.<\/p><p>There are certain weapons that will take up
        two inventory slots as opposed to one like everything else. These are:<\/p><ul><li>Calico
        Model 100 Dual Pistols<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>Dual Ingram Machine Pistols<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>Dual
        Golden Lugers<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>AK-47 Assault Rifle<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>M37
        Sniper Rifle<\/li><\/ul><p>Besides the character''s inventory, there also
        exist a number of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/item-box\/3055-6126\"
        data-ref-id=\"3055-6126\">item boxes<\/a> where players can store unwanted
        items. Item boxes are often located within save rooms (though not always)
        and items will persist throughout all item boxes across the game. Items stored
        in the box can be collected by each of the two characters; meaning that anything
        left in the item box as Claire can then be collected as Chris. However to
        take advantage of this feature players must plan before hand as there is no
        actual forewarning of when players are about to switch characters.<\/p><h3>Health
        &amp; Herbs\/First Aid Sprays<\/h3><p>A character''s health can be seen via
        the inventory menu, with an Electrocardiograph Machine showing a character''s
        status. The different statuses are:<\/p><ul><li><strong>Fine (Green)<\/strong>
        - The character is in good health.<\/li><li><strong>Caution (Yellow)<\/strong>
        - The character is roughly at half health.<\/li><li><strong>Danger (Red)<\/strong>
        - The character is approaching death.<\/li><li><strong>Poison (Purple)<\/strong>
        - The character is poisoned and their health will slowly deplete.<\/li><\/ul><p>Besides
        the EKG, players may also note the character''s stance. If a character is
        in the Caution zone, they''ll hold their chest, but move at the same speed
        as if they were perfectly fine. On the other hand if they''re in the Danger
        zone they''ll hold their chest and limp, moving incredibly slower than before.<\/p><p>Carrying
        the tradition set by the original Resident Evil, characters use a small variety
        of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/medical-herb\/3055-566\" data-ref-id=\"3055-566\">herb<\/a>s
        to heal themselves and cure poisons. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/first-aid-spray\/3055-619\"
        data-ref-id=\"3055-619\">First Aid Spray<\/a>s are also available, though
        they only have the singular purpose of healing the character fully. There
        exist three herb types, all of which can be combined in some way for different
        degrees of healing:<\/p><ul><li><b>Green Herb<\/b> - On its own will restore
        25% of health.<\/li><li><b>Blue Herb<\/b> - On its own will cure poison, though
        will not restore any health.<\/li><li><b>Red Herb<\/b> - On its own does nothing.<\/li><li><b>Green
        + Green Herb<\/b> - Mixed will heal the character by roughly 50% of health.<\/li><li><b>Green
        + Green + Green Herb<\/b> - Mixed will heal the character completely, though
        not of any poisons.<\/li><li><b>Green + Blue Herb<\/b> - Mixed will heal the
        character 25% of health and cure any poison.<\/li><li><b>Green + Green + Blue
        Herb<\/b> - Mixed will heal the character 50% of health and cure any poison.<\/li><li><b>Green
        + Red Herb<\/b> - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of
        any poisons.<\/li><li><b>Green + Red + Blue Herb<\/b> - Mixed will heal the
        character completely including poisons.<\/li><li><b>Red + Blue Herb<\/b> -
        Mixed will do nothing.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Saving<\/h3><p>As with Resident Evil
        games pre-Resident Evil 4, Code: Veronica requires that players find one of
        the many typewriters located throughout the environments to save, and must
        also have at least one ink ribbon item in their character''s inventory.<\/p><p>Should
        the player die, the game will allow them to immediately reload their latest
        save from the ''''Death'''' screen, rather than having to head back to the
        main menu.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><h3>Main Characters<\/h3><h4><a href=\"\/claire-redfield\/3005-628\"

        been taken to Rockport he goes there and learns she has been long gone. He
        has an encounter with Albert Wesker and almost dies, but is saved as Alexia
        appears on the screen and stuns Wesker because he thought she had been dead
        for years. Wesker takes off to Antarctica and Chris follows. He is reunited
        with Claire and the two of them set out to find Steve. When they find Steve
        she realizes that Alexia has been experimenting on him with the T-Veronica-Virus
        and he has mutated into a giant reptilian monster and he tries to kill Claire.
        Claire runs into a prison cell but is grabbed by Alexia''s tentacles, but
        Steve breaks through the bars and saves Claire but injures himself fatally.
        He reverts to human form and tells Claire that he loves her before dying.<\/p><p>Meanwhile,
        Wesker and Chris fight Alexia, but Wesker was overwhelmed by her strength
        and he takes off. Chris manages to defeat her, but she comes back to life
        after Chris activates the self destruct system, releasing all the locks in
        the facility freeing Claire. Chris then destroys Alexia for the final time
        and him and Claire run to the emergency elevator where they see Wesker and
        his men taking Steve''s body for further experiments. Claire runs to the plane,
        and Chris and Wesker have another showdown until they are separated by an
        explosion. Wesker vows to get his revenge next time they meet and then they
        both run to avoid dying in more explosions. The game ends with Claire and
        Chris escaping and Chris vowing to take down Umbrella once and for all.<\/p><h2>Weapons<\/h2><h3>Combat

        encountered in the Antarctica base, Moths primarily function similar to crows.
        They constantly emit a poisonous gas, however, and can also latch onto the
        player leaving a maggot sack on the characters back; the player is forced
        to wait for the character to throw the sack off before they can leave the
        area. They''re easy to kill, but because they often respawn once the player
        has leaved, it''s most profitable to dash past them.<\/p><h3>Albinoid Infant<\/h3><p>These
        are only encountered briefly when Claire Redfield enters a lab to collect
        a specific painting; they can''t be killed and only act as a minor obstacle

        a boss battle later on.<\/p><h3>Alexia Tentacle<\/h3><p>Sprouting through
        the environment, these are tentacles spawned by the now monstrous Alexia Ashford.
        They will block the players path, forcing the player to shoot any that they

        will eventually be found burrowing outside the Military Training Facility
        throughout Claire Redfield''s portion of the story. During this occasion it
        is completely optional to fight and can be largely ignored if the player is
        fast enough. The option to fight is still there, but would primarily be a
        waste of ammo since it doesn''t reward anything minus its evacuation of the
        area, and will still be encountered later on as Chris Redfield.<\/p><h3>Gulp
        Worm Part II<\/h3><p>Once Chris Redfield arrives at Rockfort Island to save
        his sister Claire, unbeknownst that she''s already left for Antarctica, he
        is ambushed by the Gulp Worm from before. After swallowing Rodrigo Juan Raval
        whole, Chris is forced to fight it. Its design includes a lot of surprise
        attacks, burrowing underground then quickly resurfacing for an attack. Sometimes
        it''ll pop out and do a kind of roar, giving players the opportunity to attack
        it.<\/p><p>While this battle is going on, the elevator that''ll take Chris
        up to the surface is making its slow descent; it essentially acts as the timer
        for the boss battle, and as such if the elevator arrives before the player
        kills the Gulp Worm, they can opt to avoid this battle and just use the elevator.
        Choosing this outcome will deprive the player of the lighter Rodrigo may give,
        however - if Claire gave it to him before hand that is.<\/p><h3>Tyrant T-103

        alternate version of the <i>Mr. X<\/i> Tyrant model encountered during Resident
        Evil 2, this model is encountered twice by Claire Redfield. It differs in

        right fist with a large claw--as is custom with most Tyrant models-- for its
        left. The first time it is encountered, the player is cornered in a narrow
        passage with the Tyrant impeding the players progress forward, with a raging
        fire blocking the rear. Should the player walk into the fire, they will die
        instantly, forcing the player to unload everything they have into the Tyrant
        as it slowly makes its advance.<\/p><h3>Tyrant T-103 Part II<\/h3><p>The Tyrant

        to escape Rockfort Island. Somehow managing to latch onto the cargo hold,
        the player has to weaken the Tyrant with gunfire and then attempt to knock
        the Tyrant out the back with a large crate released from its safety harness.
        The Tyrant is otherwise invincible and cannot be killed without attempting

        Alexander Ashford--the man twins Alfred and Alexia were cloned from--he was
        experimented on with the Veronica Virus to such an extent that he became yet
        another addition to the B.O.W. library. Initially seen through a grated floor,
        tightly strapped to a chair with a huge halberd resting on him, he eventually
        manages to escape and is fought on a rooftop by Claire Redfield. His main
        source of attack is through a constant expulsion of poisonous gas that covers
        a huge area of effect; up close, he has a series of sharp appendages that
        have sprouted out of multiple areas of his body that he can attack with. Nosferatu
        moves slowly, though the large cast of fog that covers the battleground can
        make attacking him difficult.<\/p><p>At this point the player has access to
        a Sniper Rifle with 7 shots available; using the first-person view, the player
        can potentially kill Nosferatu with a single hit should they shoot his exposed
        heart well enough. Whether Claire is poisoned during this fight also factors
        later on in the story when Chris Redfield finds her. If she was poisoned,
        Chris must search for a specific antidote (blue herbs won''t work) before
        the story can carry on.<\/p><h3>Albinoid Adult<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\"

        full grown Albinoid creature Claire encountered only hours before has now
        fully grown into a huge amphibious lizard-like monster. Completely surfaced
        under a shallow pool--literally, within a swimming pool--it is the de-facto
        guardian of an emblem the player needs to collect. The Albinoid will periodically
        discharge an aura of electricity, however, making it very dangerous to enter.
        The Albinoid is completely harmless otherwise, as it doesn''t leave the pool.
        The player can opt to kill it, but if timed right can also enter the pool
        and collect the emblem with minimal damage.<\/p><h3>Giant Black Widow<\/h3><figure

        seen under a sea of ice covering the main hall of the Umbrella Antarctica
        Base, Chris Redfield is forced to use a crane to crack the ice open to pull
        out the corpse of Nosferatu to claim his signet ring. This of course unleashes
        the Giant Black Widow. Simply massive, the Black Widow attacks much like its
        smaller kin but with a much larger poison spit arc.<\/p><h3>Steve Burnside<\/h3><figure

        her father Alexander, Alexia infected Steve Burnside with the Veronica virus
        after she captured him and Claire. With a brief stint back as Claire during
        Chris'' portion of the story, she finds him strapped to a chair with a large
        halberd resting on him exactly like Alexander. Just as Claire attempts to
        release him from the chair, Steve begins to mutate turning into a kind of
        green ogre. He equips the halberd with ease and begins to chase Claire. Steve
        isn''t intended to be fought and the player can only run, as Steve can kill
        the player with just two hits, and a series of gates are being locked down
        through the hallway, forcing the player to stop for nothing.<\/p><h3>Alexia

        Wesker only just scraping by; noticing Chris Redfield hiding nearby, he calls
        it onto his ''''best man'''' to take care of her. Alexia herself is a relatively
        easy battle as they go, but her attacks can do severe damage. She will walk
        slowly towards the player, leeching a small line of blood which quickly bursts
        into flames. If the player is caught in it they have to wait through the animation
        of Chris attempting to wave the flames off.<\/p><h3>Alexia Ashford Sack Form<\/h3><figure

        is initially seen once again in her humanoid form as she halts Claire as she
        attempts to run away. If the player doesn''t react, shooting Alexia with literally
        anything, then Alexia will kill Claire causing a game over. If the player
        does shoot her, she will then transform into a huge blob creature with what
        look like dragonfly wings, but still retaining the majority of her previous
        mutations face. Because of Alexia''s size, the player has very little room
        to maneuver and only has running access on a roughly 75 degree angle. Alexia
        herself mostly relies on her large tentacles that''ll slam down on the player.
        She also summons a group of small pod like creatures that plant themselves
        and spout out a strange tail that''ll whip the player. The player can kill
        them, (though they prove difficult because of their size) but Alexia will
        eventually replace them with more. In true Resident Evil fashion, a five minute
        timer is ticking down during this battle.<\/p><h3>Alexia Ashford Dragonfly

        Alexia Sack Form has taken enough damage, she will exit her sack and hover
        above the player. At the same time the Linear Launcher, which Chris and Claire
        prepared to power-up, is now available. Using the Linear Launcher, the player
        is to try and shoot down Alexia; her constant movement can make this tricky,
        however. Her only attack during this form is that same line of fluid she shoots
        out that bursts into flames. This form of Alexia isn''t particularly difficult
        as a boss and the difficulty is built around the 5 minute timer that''ll still
        be ticking down during this battle.<\/p><h2>Battle Game<\/h2><figure data-align=\"left\"

        Battle Game is a time-trial mode that is unlocked after a single completion
        of the main game. Here it allows the player to choose from a select few of
        the main cast from Veronica X to play as and make their way through a set
        number of rooms. The rooms themselves are all unrelated to one another and
        stretch across environments throughout the entire game. Each character has
        their own unique load-out, though they have infinite ammo for all weapons;
        the main goal of the mode is to primarily get a decent time, rather than try
        make do with limited supplies. To pass on to the next room, however, every
        enemy must first be killed.<\/p><p>Initially, only Claire and Chris are available,
        though if the player finds the broken Golden Luger pistol during the main
        game, Steve Burnside will be unlocked from the outset. He can otherwise still
        be unlocked if the player completes the mode as Claire. Albert Wesker also
        makes his playable debut for the Battle Game, and is unlocked via a completion
        with Chris in the mode. The final character is an alternate costume of Claire
        that is also unlocked after a single completion as default Claire in the Battle
        Game. Claire''s alternate costume is exclusive for the Battle Game mode, however,
        and cannot be worn through the main game. Should the player get an S ranking
        for all characters, they unlock a Linear Launcher with infinite ammo (the
        Linear Launcher is also unlockable with infinite ammo for the main-game if
        the player scores an S ranking).<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10354\/1889500-end___4_.png\"

        combating Soldier Majini<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Resident Evil 5 carries
        on much of the gameplay design and control scheme from <a href=\"\/resident-evil-4\/3030-1578\"
        data-ref-id=\"3030-1578\">Resident Evil 4<\/a> before it. It functions primarily
        as a third-person shooter with an <a href=\"\/over-the-shoulder\/3015-2621\"
        data-ref-id=\"3015-2621\">over-the-shoulder<\/a> perspective, only players
        cannot simultaneously move and shoot. This then gives the game a more methodical
        feel that prioritises accuracy and crowd management rather than commonly hunkering
        behind cover or running &amp; gunning. Though while there is in fact a cover
        system, it is relatively rudimentary and is only accessible at specific segments
        -- most notably during when enemies that can shoot back such as Soldier Majini
        are introduced. When available, players can pop-out to fire, but cannot shimmy
        along nor dive between different pieces of cover.<\/p><p>For as much as RE5
        resembles RE4, it still nonetheless carves out its own identity by way of
        its faster pace and more action-orientated focus. Puzzles have been near-completely
        removed, and RE5 has adopted a more modern shooter control scheme that by
        default has players aim with L1\/LB and shoot with R1\/RB. Characters can
        now slowly strafe left or right as well, though amongst the four variable
        control schemes exists the ''Classic'' Type D, which has RE5 control much
        like RE4. However that also includes removing the player''s ability to strafe.
        A basic map in the top right corner of the screen can be displayed by pressing
        R2\/RT. It won''t disclose the information of enemy locations, but will at
        least visualise the blueprint-like design of the area.<\/p><p>The story is
        now told almost-exclusively via in-game cutscenes this time around, though
        nearing the later segments there are still a number of Files (diaries, memos
        ect.) that shed light on the series'' backstory and mythos.<\/p><p>The most
        notary change from RE4 is the addition of a secondary character that persists
        throughout the whole game, in both single-player and cooperative formats.

        in-game inventory display<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Possibly the most notable
        overhaul is the inventory system. Long gone is the tetris-like inventory management
        of Resident Evil 4, and in its stead is a new format that is presented as
        a grid made up of nine squares -- each of which can hold any type of weapon
        or item. Players press triangle\/Y to bring up their inventory, where they
        can then choose to move around their items into whichever square they desire.
        However inventory management is done in real time, and players cannot move
        whilst in their inventory leaving them potentially vulnerable to attack. To
        compensate, players can now once again reload their weapons via their inventory
        screen--by moving ammo towards the hypothetical weapon square--as opposed
        to only being able to do so manually like in RE4. Due to the animation-priority
        concerning certain actions, this allows players to reload their weapons or
        move items around while the character is climbing a ladder or opening a door
        for example. The speed with which the inventory menu can be opened &amp; closed
        attributes to this factor also.<\/p><p>Another benefit is with the use of
        the d-pad players can select between whatever items they have in the top,
        left, right, and bottom squares. This thusly allows players to switch between
        their weapons in real time.<\/p><p>There is no longer a mysterious merchant
        by which players buy and upgrade their weapons. Instead there is a HUB that
        the player can use to store unwanted weaponry or ammunition and so forth,
        and can then use their accumulated gold from killing enemies to potentially
        buy new weapons or upgrade their current ones. Though not all weapons are
        available for purchase; some are unlocked as the story progresses, while others
        are made available once other certain weapons have been fully upgraded. Treasures
        can once again be collected through the game, be they hidden within the environment
        or dropped by a powerful enemy, which can be sold in the HUB for additional
        cash. Treasures cannot be combined like in RE4 for an increase in value, however.<\/p><figure

        Inventory &amp; Cooperative HUB<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Players are sent
        to the HUB whenever they re-enter the story should they have quitted earlier,
        in-between story chapters, and even when they die. Whatever treasures\/weapons\/ammunition
        the player may have collected (or used up, in the case of ammunition) before
        reaching a hard checkpoint will still persist in the player''s inventory when
        they are sent back to the HUB. Players can also access it via the game''s
        main menu as well.<\/p><h3>Health &amp; Healing Items<\/h3><p>A character''s
        health is now again represented as 3\/4''s of a circle; whence damaged, the
        health of the circle will deplete and change color the more health is lost.
        A character''s extent of health is static and cannot be upgraded with yellow
        herbs anymore, though there are items that can be equipped to reduce damage.<\/p><p>While
        yellow herbs are no longer available, green and red still persist and can
        be combined to increase their effectiveness. A list of herbs and their effectiveness
        is as follows:<\/p><ul><li><strong>Green Herb<\/strong> - On its own will
        heal roughly 25% of health.<\/li><li><strong>Green + Green Herb<\/strong>
        - Mixed will now health roughly 50% of health.<\/li><li><strong>Green + Red
        Herb<\/strong> - Mixed will heal the player character fully.<\/li><li><strong>Red
        Herb<\/strong> - On its own will do nothing.<\/li><\/ul><p>Besides herbs,
        first aid sprays are available for use and like always will heal the character
        fully. Eggs can also be found throughout the game in three varieties:<\/p><ul><li><strong>White<\/strong>
        - Roughly heals about 30% of health<\/li><li><strong>Brown<\/strong> - Roughly
        heals about 40% of health<\/li><li><strong>Gold<\/strong> - Heals a character
        fully.<\/li><\/ul><p>While they''re ordinarily found like any other item,
        the player will sometimes encounter chickens. If a player scares it enough,
        be it by aiming or shooting near one, there''s a chance it''ll lay an egg
        the player can collect. Snakes also exist within the world (and often like
        to hide within destructible crates\/barrels) that have a chance of dropping
        an egg whence killed, too.<\/p><p>When healing with a herb mixture or first
        aid spray it''s beneficial that the characters are close by as it will heal
        them both -- eggs, however, will not. Though they do at least have the advantage
        of being stackable, with up to five of a single variety being able to fit
        into a single inventory square.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\"

        shown to be in the ''Dying'' state.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>When a character''s
        health gets into the red the player will visually walk with their hand on
        their hip with a slight decrease in movement speed. Should a character lose
        all of their health, however, they will go into the Dying state -- represented
        by the fourth segment of the circle. When in the Dying state players can only
        slowly limp while what remains of their dying gauge begins to drop; the only
        way out of it is if the other character can either heal them with a herb\/first
        aid spray, or will otherwise administer a shot of adrenaline to bring them
        out of it -- a prompt to do so for both actions will appear on the saviour
        character''s screen. The shot will not heal any health, however, and any attack
        will throw the character back in the Dying state--if not kill them outright--which
        will continue to drop from whence it was left before the player was pulled
        out of it.<\/p><h3>Cooperative Gameplay<\/h3><p>In-line with the game''s bigger
        emphasis on action, the whole of RE5''s story can be played cooperatively
        for up to two-players. By default player 1 is always Chris Redfield while
        the second takes control of Sheva Alomar. Though upon completing the game
        the first player can then choose which character they want to play as. RE5
        can be played cooperatively Online, though split-screen and even LAN are available
        methods also. However there is no drop-in drop-out functionality; whence a
        new player joins an online game, the game will take both players back to the
        HUB screen as mentioned before.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\"

        story characters Sheva &amp; Chris<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Both Chris &amp;
        Sheva play almost the exact same as one another, and have the same capabilities
        and can use nearly all of the weapons available in the game, however they
        each have their own single, exclusive weapon that only they can use. The one
        major difference between how they each play is their perspective; Chris, like
        the playable characters of RE4 before him, aims over his right shoulder, whereas
        Sheva aims over her left. This was done to give the game a more pleasing visual
        aesthetic in split-screen mode.<\/p><p>There are a number of times throughout
        the game where the two characters are forced to split-up. This usually involves
        Sheva, with the help of Chris, leaping over a gap to reach another part of
        the environment to collect a key item -- while the other may likely be able
        to provide cover fire. However since the players are split up, they can no
        longer heal each other nor bring the other back out of the dying state. Though
        sequences where characters split-up are short-lived.<\/p><p>Players are able
        to trade supplies such as ammunition and healing items (thought not weapons)
        between each other both in-game and in the HUB. There is also a small series
        of in-game commands players can give each other. These are: Go, Wait, Come
        On, and Thanks. Go, Wait, and Thanks are triggered by holding (by default)
        the circle\/B button down, and then choosing from the three commands with
        the d-pad; Come On is triggered by simply pressing the circle\/B button. Though
        Thanks can also be triggered this way in response to assistance from the other
        character, such as after being gifted\/traded an item or after being saved
        from an enemy grappling the player. Pressing circle\/B when the player''s
        partner scores a headshot or manages to successfully enact a follow-up melee
        attack will also have their character compliment their partner.<\/p><p>With
        the map up, both players will be shown. Though if one player gets out of range
        of the map, the other player can then hold down L2 directing the player''s
        attention to the location of the other player.<\/p><h3>Secondary Character
        AI<\/h3><p>When playing in single-player the secondary character will still
        persist, but is now controlled by a friendly AI. However it is still just
        as vulnerable as the player and shares all of the same gameplay mechanics
        and trappings, including its own 9-square inventory grid. It will often act
        of its own accord and will fire at whatever enemy it encounters, regardless
        of how much ammunition it has. It will heal itself when damaged and usually
        knows which healing item is most suitable, though it will usually rush to
        the player first to make sure they both get healed -- regardless of whether
        the player actually requires healing or not. It will also collect supplies
        on its own, though will at least give some to the player should they feel
        the player is in need of them, or if it collected ammunition it can''t use.
        Though this may not always be the case.<\/p><p>Fortunately it will gladly
        trade items with the player when requested and will even always thank the
        player for any assistance as well. However because it tends to go through
        ammo relatively quickly, it''s advised that the human player equips themselves
        with different weapons to the AI. Such as for example sticking the AI with
        an SMG or Assault Rifle while the player uses a Handgun. As it''s an AI, its
        accuracy is very high, thus it excels with Sniper Rifles in particular. While
        it will use whatever firearms it has at its disposal, it will not use any
        explosive weapons such as the RPG Launcher, Grenade Launcher, or even grenades.<\/p><p>When
        the player is forced to split-up with the AI it will follow a specific script,
        be it collecting the necessary key item or unlocking a door, and will then
        attempt to regroup with the player ASAP. It will at least attempt to defend
        itself when necessary, though it will not revert to its default patterns until
        it is reunited with the player.<\/p><p>Though while it is largely agreed upon
        by its community that Resident Evil 5 makes for a better experience when playing
        cooperatively, it''s worth noting there is unique dialogue in the single-player
        version--dialogue that also differs dependant on whether the player is controlling
        Chris or Sheva--that isn''t heard otherwise.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\"

        Though unlike Sheva, Josh Stone sticks to a script and isn''t as dynamic as
        the player''s partner AI. He is often shown trying to work a piece of machinery
        to help open the way. During the first scenario Josh will defend himself when
        necessary, equipped with an M9SF pistol, but can also die if he receives enough

        return and are again most commonly encountered should a player be grabbed
        by an enemy--which''ll require the player to wiggle the right analogue--or
        in the case of bosses to sometimes avoid an attack entirely. They are also
        encountered during specific cutscenes, where the player must press the on-screen
        prompts as they appear otherwise they will die. Sometimes players may also
        have to rapidly tap a single button as well, usually as a means to further
        illustrate a scene depicting a struggle for example.<\/p><p>If playing cooperatively,
        cutscene QTEs are divided between players depending on which character is
        doing the action on-screen. Though there are still some that require both
        players to press the prompts simultaneously.<\/p><h3>Melee Combat<\/h3><p>Melee
        attacks return and have been further expanded upon. When fighting the variety
        of regular Majini enemies, shooting them in the head, leg, or shoulder will
        stun them for a couple of seconds, allowing players to then perform a powerful
        melee attack by way of a prompt next to the stunned enemy. Though depending
        on which part of the Majini is shot will prompt a different attack -- Chris
        &amp; Sheva each have unique melee attacks as well. Characters are also invulnerable
        whilst performing a melee attack, making them suitable for both offence and
        defense.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10354\/2637078-st-106.jpg\"

        managing to hit two Majini at once with a Right Hook<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Certain
        melee attacks can be chained between characters, with for example Chris enacting
        one following by Sheva committing another, with Chris unleashing a final third.
        The third attack of the chain is extremely powerful and cannot be triggered
        any other way beyond being the final attack of a combo. They will most often
        be used against the larger enemies, as they tend to stagger rather than get
        knocked to the ground like common Majini enemies. When playing alone with
        the AI, it will attempt to chain melee attacks with the player when possible,
        though it will usually rely on firearms more so than melee attacks.<\/p><p>A
        list of Chris &amp; Sheva''s melee attacks are as follows:<\/p><h4><strong>Chris:<\/strong><\/h4><ul><li><strong>Straight
        Punch<\/strong> - A straight lung, usually only striking a single enemy but
        may still knock the enemy far enough to topple over other enemies. Is often
        comically compared to<a href=\"\/captain-falcon\/3005-1215\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1215\">
        Captain Falcon<\/a>''s Falcon Punch attack in <a href=\"\/nintendo\/3010-90\"
        data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo<\/a>''s <a href=\"\/super-smash-bros\/3030-19125\"
        data-ref-id=\"3030-19125\">Super Smash Brothers<\/a> franchise. Within the
        context of a regular Majini enemy, it is actionable when it has been shot
        to the face and is forced to clasp its face.<\/li><li><strong>Right Hook<\/strong>
        - Chris'' weakest attack, though it has a good chance of hitting multiple
        enemies and is useful for potentially starting a combo with Sheva. Within
        the context of a regular Majini enemy, this attack is actionable when it has
        been shot in the left or right shoulder.<\/li><li><strong>Kick - <\/strong>Another
        relatively weak attack, this too is primarily useful for leading into another
        attack by Sheva. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, this attack
        is actionable from behind when it has been shot in the left or right shoulder.<\/li><li><strong>Uppercut
        - <\/strong>Roughly about the same power as the Straight Punch, the uppercut
        has a better chance of hitting multiple enemies. Within the context of a regular
        Majini enemy, this attack is actionable from the front when it has been shot
        at the knee and keels over in pain for a few seconds.<\/li><li><strong>Neck
        Snap<\/strong> - Chris'' most powerful attack as it will kill a regular Majini
        instantly. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, this attack is actionable
        from the back when it has been shot at the knee and keels over in pain for
        a few seconds.<\/li><li><strong>Stomp - <\/strong>A very powerful attack,
        and one that may often act as a finisher due to the damage an enemy may have
        already received to get knocked over. Within the context of a regular Majini
        enemy, this attack is actionable when it has been knocked to the ground.<\/li><li><strong>Haymaker<\/strong>
        - Besides the Neck Snap, this is easily Chris'' most powerful attack. However
        it can only be performed as the third attack of a combo chain--beginning with
        Chris--and when directed at an enemy from the front.<\/li><li><strong>Backhand<\/strong>
        - Like the Haymaker, this too deals an equally incredible amount of damage.
        However it can only be performed as the third attack of a combo chain--beginning
        with Chris--and when directed at an enemy from the back.<\/li><li><strong>Top
        Down Punch<\/strong> - A relatively weak attack, this is the attack Chris
        uses against an enemy that is currently grappling the other character. It
        visually resembles <a href=\"\/ryu\/3005-103\" data-ref-id=\"3005-103\">Ryu<\/a>''s
        top down punch from the <a href=\"\/street-fighter-alpha\/3025-960\" data-ref-id=\"3025-960\">Street
        Fighter Alpha<\/a> series.<\/li><\/ul><h4><strong>Sheva:<\/strong><\/h4><ul><li><strong>Roundhouse
        Kick<\/strong> - A reliable manoeuvre due to its high likelihood that it''ll
        disperse a crowd, and can at least knock an enemy over. Within the context
        of a regular Majini enemy, it is actionable when it has been shot to the face
        and is forced to clasp its face.<\/li><li><strong>Twist Kick<\/strong> - Sheva''s
        weakest attack, and is only primarily useful for potentially starting a combo
        chain with Chris. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, this attack
        is actionable when it has been shot in the left or right shoulder.<\/li><li><strong>Knee<\/strong>
        - Another relatively weak attack, this too is primarily useful for leading
        into another attack by Chris. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy,
        this attack is actionable from behind when it has been shot in the left or
        right shoulder.<\/li><li><strong>Somersault<\/strong> - Somewhat reminiscent
        of <a href=\"\/guile\/3005-266\" data-ref-id=\"3005-266\">Guile<\/a> from
        Street Fighter''s Flask Kick move, Sheva''s somersault does a high amount
        of damage, but will often only manage to hit a single enemy. Within the context
        of a regular Majini enemy, this attack is actionable from the front when it
        has been shot at the knee and keels over in pain for a few seconds.<\/li><li><strong>Throat
        Slice<\/strong> - Sheva''s most powerful attack, as like Chris'' Neck Snap
        will kill a regular Majini instantly. However the animation is noticeably
        longer overall. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, this attack
        is actionable from the back when it has been shot at the knee and keels over
        in pain for a few seconds.<\/li><li><strong>Impale<\/strong> - A very powerful
        attack, even more so than Chris'' stomp, and one that may often act as a finisher
        due to the damage an enemy may have already received to get knocked over.
        Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, this attack is actionable when
        it has been knocked to the ground.<\/li><li><strong>Skull Crusher - <\/strong>Besides
        the Throat Slice, this is easily Sheva''s most powerful attack. However it
        can only be performed as the third attack of a combo chain--beginning with
        Sheva--and when directed at an enemy from the front.<\/li><li><strong>Spinning
        Back Kick<\/strong> - Like the Skull Crusher, this too deals an equally incredible
        amount of damage. However it can only be performed as the third attack of
        a combo chain--beginning with Sheva--and when directed at an enemy from the
        back.<\/li><li><strong>Pivot Kick<\/strong> - A relatively weak attack, this
        is the attack Sheva uses against an enemy that is currently grappling the
        other character.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Story<\/h2><h3>Main Characters<\/h3><h4><a

        original leading hero Chris Redfield. Now apart of the B.S.A.A., a non-profit
        military organisation that exists to combat Bio-Organic threats, Redfield''s
        latest mission takes him to West Africa.<\/p><p>While he would ordinarily
        be partnered with long-time friend Jill Valentine, 3 years earlier she was
        attacked and presumably killed by Albert Wesker. As such, Chris chose to travel
        to Africa alone. Though when arriving, he is quickly partnered up with Sheva
        Alomar, a West African native and fellow B.S.A.A. agent.<\/p><p>The two are
        to investigate the fishing town of Kijuju, as there is purported to be a B.O.W.
        arms deal planning to be put underway, lead by Oil businessman Ricardo Irving.
        It isn''t long before the locals are quickly revealed to all have been infected
        with the Las Plagas -- a parasite first encountered by Leon S. Kennedy in
        Spain. Upon being forced to fight their way through hordes of infected civilians,
        the two are able to locate Alpha team of the BSAA, who were planning to apprehend
        and question Irving. However they are heard in combat via radio and communication
        is cut off. Chris and Sheva are soon able to locate Alpha team, however it
        was too late; all of them were killed, with team captain DeChant as the only
        survivor. He claims they were set-up, but before he can divulge anymore information
        dies due to his injuries.<\/p><p>It isn''t long before two then encounter
        what killed Alpha team -- Uroborus, a new type of B.O.W. even Chris hasn''t
        encountered before. Utilising the nearby furnace, they discover it is weak
        to fire and use it to kill the monster.<\/p><p>From there they meet up with
        Josh Stone, captain of the West African branch''s Delta team. He provides
        them with information regarding Irving''s whereabouts before going off for
        backup. Chris &amp; Sheva keep on the tail and are able to corner Irving.
        However he is rescued by a woman concealed by a bird mask and cloak. The duo
        are thusly forced to continue the chase.<\/p><p>Upon meeting up with B.S.A.A.
        member <a href=\"\/dave-johnson\/3005-15420\" data-ref-id=\"3005-15420\">Dave
        Johnson<\/a>, they hitch a ride on his humvee. Though upon their arrival at
        the next checkpoint, they are ambushed by a massive creature called N''desu.
        It kills Dave, but is then taken down thanks to the weaponry located on the
        humvee by Chris and Sheva. After travelling through a Tribal Village that
        has also been infected with the Las Plagas, with the return of Josh they are
        then able to finally reach Irving once more on his yacht.<\/p><p>However,
        Irving injects himself with a Master Plagas sample, rapidly transforming himself
        into a humongous, amphibious monster. With the use of the gatling and rocket
        turrets on his boat, the two are able to kill it. Barely hanging on to life,
        what remains of Irving--who was functioning as the uvula of the creature--upon
        realising the male agent that killed was Chris Redfield, states the two should
        head to the nearby cave and look for an ''''<a href=\"\/excella-gionne\/3005-8921\"

        fight their way through the cave, which is infested with more Las Plagas-infected
        tribesman. They eventually are introduced to Excella, the CEO of Tricell who
        are in fact a B.S.A.A. benefactor. Like Irving she continually gives them
        the slip. Upon their chase, Chris discovers that Jill Valentine may actually
        be alive; footage of her in a test beacon is found on an Umbrella computer.
        Chris demands answers from Excella, but she instead unleashes a huge crab-like
        B.O.W. Though this too is bested by the combined skill of Chris and Sheva.<\/p><p>Upon
        reaching Excella within an underground temple, Chris'' arch-nemesis Albert
        Wesker reveals himself, alongside the woman wearing the bird mask. The woman
        is also then revealed to be Jill Valentine, however she is shown to be a puppet
        of Wesker and follows his command.<\/p><p>While Excella leaves the scene,
        Wesker opts to engage in a two-vs-two fight; Chris &amp; Sheva vs Wesker &amp;
        Jill. Wesker, however, still retains all of his super-human agility and strength,
        and cannot be fought by normal means. As such, Sheva attempts to keep Jill
        occupied--whom while is incredibly aggressive is still only human--while Chris
        lures Wesker into the side corridors of the temple. From there he uses stealth
        to catch Wesker off guard, doing whatever damage he can. Eventually, Wesker
        is forced to draw the fight to a premature close due to other business, but
        leaves Jill to finish them off.<\/p><p>Jill soon reveals by opening up her
        battlesuit that she is being controlled by a strange virus that is continually
        being pumped into her system. Upon Chris using his voice to remind her of
        him, he is able to temporarily confuse her enough so as to try and tear the
        device off. With the help of Sheva, they are finally able to tear the thing
        off completely. While back to her normal self Jill is still in a weakened
        state, and urges them to go and stop Wesker without her. But only before she
        indulges vital information regarding Wesker''s own virus; by over-dosing him
        with a specific serum, that''ll then course it to act as a poison. She also
        reveals Wesker''s plan to use jets to unleash Uroborus upon the world. With
        this information in hand, Chris &amp; Sheva go after Wesker.<\/p><p>Upon arriving
        on Wesker''s battleship, they encounter Excella. However it turns out that
        she was betrayed by Wesker and infected with Uroborus so as to slow the two
        down. Excella begins to vomit out black-as-night tentacles, which envelop
        her as well as a small mountain of corpses nearby Wesker must have placed.<\/p><p>It
        grows large enough to practically encompass the entire ship, though with the
        use of a portable ion cannon Chris &amp; Sheva are able to destroy the creature,
        while also finding the aforementioned serum in Excella''s briefcase amidst
        it all.<\/p><p>The two again catch up to Wesker and do battle with him in
        the hanger; amidst the fight Wesker''s explains his motivation to create a
        new world order via natural selection with Uroborus. With the use of an RPG,
        they are able to weaken him enough so as to inject the serum. However is able
        to escape onto a jet; Chris and Sheva soon join him and another battle occurs,
        with Sheva injecting Wesker with the serum once more.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\"

        there are the Soldier Majini, who are the most advanced of the three Majini
        varieties. They are intelligent enough to know how to use automatic firearms
        and utilise cover, work together more efficiently, and will even make sound
        use of grenades, cattle prods and bulletproof shields. The Soldier Majini
        suffer one notable drawback, however, in that some will often be found wearing
        an array of grenades over their chest, introducing an opportunity for players
        to take advantage and kill the Majini instantly by shooting the grenades.<\/p><h3>Common
        Majini Mutations<\/h3><p>Like the Ganado before them, once Majini have taken

        most common mutation, usually brought forth after a successful headshot, Cephalo
        is a plagas that protrudes out of a Majini''s neck, almost resembling a large
        centipede. The Majini will no longer make use of any weapons they previously
        used and will instead use the plagas almost like a whip to swipe the player.
        Because of the many skittering legs that litter the plagas, simply being too
        close to the mutated Majini can inflict damage without the Majini actually
        initiating an attack. Damage to the plagas host is now largely ineffective,
        and the Majini from then on is most vulnerable by shooting the plagas itself.<\/p><h4>Kipepeo<\/h4><figure

        second most common mutation, and another that is largely ported from one such
        Ganado mutation in Resident Evil 4. This one is a form a flying plagas that
        bursts out of the Majini''s back once it has received enough damage. Once
        airborne and out of its host, its attacks are sporadic and unpredictable,
        and it can also quickly dart out of the way should the player aim at it. Otherwise
        it is relatively weak and can be taken down in groups easy with a few accurate
        shotgun rounds.<\/p><h4>Duvalia<\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\"

        encountered against the soldier Majini, the Duvalia, as is custom with mutations,
        occurs once the Majini has received so much damage. Then the Majini begins
        to rapidly mutate into what almost looks like an exotic flower. The entire
        upper-half of the Majini is enclosed within an impenetrable shell, with the
        vulnerable ''mouth'' residing with. The Duvalia will primarily try to whack
        the player using its shell, but given the chance should the player get close
        enough will open its shell and ''chomp'' the player, instantly placing the
        player in the dying state. The only way to kill it is to shoot the lower regions
        of the Majini, forcing the Duvalia to fall onto its knees with the shell open,
        then shooting the inside.<\/p><h4>Explosion<\/h4><p>While not a mutation per

        they were originally meant to be another Majini mutation, for the final game

        minimal damage, but they also restrict the player to only walking as they
        struggle to remove the Kichwa. This then allows other enemies in the vicinity
        to more easily attack the player.<\/p><p>They are otherwise dispatched easily
        enough with just one or two pistol rounds. Because of their small size, however,

        and are equally as sturdy. Though unlike Salvador, before Chainsaw Majini
        strike they tend to laugh manically often giving the player an added second
        to escape the Majini''s attack range.<\/p><p>There are two versions of the
        Chainsaw Majini distinguished by the color of their trousers. The Chainsaw
        Majini wearing red, once killed, will stay dead. The ones wearing blue, however,

        main game, though are much more prevalent in other areas of the game including
        the Mercenaries modes and Desperate Escape DLC story.<\/p><p>Wielding a massive
        hammer, they will pull it along the ground and slowly slam it unto the player
        should the player be close enough. The attack itself will empty a character''s
        entire health bar, leaving them in the dying state. Besides that, the Executioner
        may also pick up the player forcing them to quickly tap a button to escape,
        or to rely on their partner to save them. If neither is successful, the Executioner
        throws the player to the ground and will execute and kill the player instantly
        - ignoring the dying state completely.<\/p><p>There is another variant encountered
        only in the Prison map for the Mercenaries modes. It functions exactly the
        same as the regular Executioner, though it has a different appearance, wearing

        what looks like a massive humanoid cockroach, Reapers are an accidental creation
        courtesy of exposure from the Uroboros virus. Reapers are pretty much indestructible
        lest the player shoots their weak points, which are littered across the back
        of the Reaper and will sporadically expose themselves only for a second. Should
        the player manage to shoot one of the weak points, the Reaper keels over revealing
        two more weak points, finally resulting in the Reaper bending backwards to
        reveal its most vulnerable region within the middle of its carapace.<\/p><p>If
        the player shoots anywhere else besides one of the telegraphed weak points,
        the Reaper emits a mist which clouds the player''s vision of the Reaper. Because
        of their high demand for precise timing to kill it, and the fact that they
        can swiftly kill a player instantly should they get close enough, Reapers
        are arguably one of the most antagonizing enemies of the game.<\/p><h3>Licker

        recognised for their appearance in <a href=\"\/resident-evil-2\/3030-9418\"
        data-ref-id=\"3030-9418\">Resident Evil 2<\/a>, Licker \u03b2''s are an advanced
        form of Lickers that have been injected with the progenitor virus. While they
        largely look the same, they are noticeably bigger in mass with more muscle.
        The most notary difference is for their resistance to bullets, allowing them
        to withstand copious amounts of firearm fire. Unlike the original Lickers,
        however, Licker \u03b2''s have one particular weakness: Their exposed heart.
        Because of this, should the player manage to knock a Licker onto its back,
        they can then commit and instant kill by way of a button prompt allowing them
        to stab the Licker directly in its heart. One other weakness they have inherited
        over their predecessors is their inability to see. Though they have highly
        acute hearing, it is possible during some occasions for the player to avoid
        combat with Lickers altogether as long as they walk past without firing their
        weapons.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10354\/2234162-licker4__article_image.jpg\"

        \u03b2''s still attack using the same array of moves, including their tongue
        which they now use to pierce a character''s shoulder continually draining
        the character''s health the longer it stays. Their large claws are also an
        asset Licker''s will often use given the chance if a player is close enough,
        or sometimes they will even leap across the air - potentially grabbing the
        player and killing them instantly by stabbing them if the player''s partner
        can''t save them in time. One final similarity Licker \u03b2''s have with
        their predecessors is the ability to maneuver across flat surfaces, crawling
        up walls and across ceilings.<\/p><h3>Guardian of Insanity<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\"

        encountered during the Lost in Nightmares story DLC, the Guardians of Insanity
        are an iteration of the Executioner Majini seen during Resident Evil 5. They
        lumber around carrying large anchors rather than hammers, however, and are
        also much more resistant to gunfire. Shooting them forces them to temporarily
        bleed acid, which does minimal damage but will also stun the player if caught
        within the splash. The most suitable tactic for beating the creatures is to
        shoot the small eye it has located on the back on its large hump.<\/p><p>Unlike
        the Executioners, should a Guardian manage to grab the player, they need their
        partner to save them otherwise the player currently grabbed will die - no
        QTE''s to allow them to escape the Guardian''s grasp.<\/p><h3>Crocodiles<\/h3><p>While
        not infected, the native crocodiles of West Africa are much more so aggressive
        than average crocs. They are only encountered during the marshlands: First
        whilst the player is riding a raft, as the crocodiles attempt to bite them,
        and secondly as the player is traversing waist-high water to reach a small
        settlement of huts. On the raft they can only be avoided via QTE''s, but when
        travelling through the water they can be killed. The crocodiles are unusually
        sturdy against gunfire, however, and should they get close enough can kill
        the player instantly.<\/p><h2>Boss Battles<\/h2><h3>Uroboros Test Subject<\/h3><figure

        the player''s health until they reach the dying state. It has fairly slow

        though they can also attempt to lure it into the nearby furnace then stun
        it by using, for example, an incendiary grenade, and then turn on the furnace.
        It takes two attempts to kill it using this method, but would still save players

        though the second may be avoided if the player can manage to outrun it. For
        both appearances the boss fight plays out the same.<\/p><p>Resembling a giant
        bat with a scorpions tail, it will switch between chasing the player on the
        ground, and hounding the player from the air. Popokarimu''s front is impenetrable
        from gunfire, though its rear up its tail is highly vulnerable. The most suitable
        strategy is for the player to lay down mines; after the Popokarimu comes in
        vicinity, the explosion will knock it over giving the player ample time to
        fire at its weak point. Otherwise, if its a cooperative game, one player can

        attacks using similar such tactics as its El Gigante brethren; with its brute
        strength it attempts to smash and stamp down on the Humvee, while also picking
        up power posts and even a boulder to throw at the vehicle. The player is tasked
        with continually shooting at whatever Ndesu equips to quickly cause him to
        flinch so he''ll drop his weapon. Besides Ndesu there are a small squadron
        of Kijuju Majin that''ll attack the player with molotovs or by using their
        crossbows. They are easily dispatched thanks to the turret''s power, however
        another group will always return after an allotted time until the battle is
        over.<\/p><p>After it takes so much damage, the many Las Plagas within erupt
        out of its skin. Once they''ve been killed, Ndesu keels over for a much larger
        parasite to expose itself out of its back giving players the chance to finally
        shoot at its weak point. After 2-3 assaults on the main Las Plagas parasite,
        Ndesu is finally killed.<\/p><h3>Ricardo Irving<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\"

        of his failure at stopping Chris &amp; Sheva''s pursuit, Jill Valentine currently
        in her ''Bird Lady'' outfit hands Irving a vial with a Master Plagas sample,
        and orders him to use it should he be cornered. As such, once Chris &amp;
        Sheva manage to finally catch up to Irving on his luxury boat, he gives in
        to the potential power a Master Plagas would give and injects himself with
        it.<\/p><p>It only takes seconds for the parasite to cause Ricardo to mutate;
        after leaping into the water, Irving soon resurfaces as a monstrously huge
        amphibious creature. Because this is the work of a Master Plagas, Irving has
        complete control over his actions. To fight back against the beast, players
        must use the turrets conveniently located on Irving''s boat. Two miniguns
        and two rocket launchers, players are to shoot at the glowing weak point until
        it submerges and its tendrils pop out in exchange. Occasionally, it will swim
        up to attempt to bite the player with its gigantic maw; a button prompt will
        quickly appear so as the player can avoid the attack. Soon after so much punishment,
        the creature latches onto the boat as Ricardo, now essentially functioning
        as the uvula of the monster, reveals himself so as the player can shoot him.
        After so many attempts, the beast soon spits out Ricardo''s body as it dies.
        Ricardo then soon follows as his sack-like body disintegrates.<\/p><h3>U-8<\/h3><figure

        U standing for ''Ultimate'', U-8 is a massive crab-like B.O.W. Excella Gionne
        unleashes to attempt to kill Chris &amp; Sheva. Acting as a blockade stopping
        the elevator they''re currently on from descending any further, the duo have
        no choice but to fight against the U-8. Because of its size, its mass stretches
        across nearly half the size of the elevator; its weak points are the patches
        of fleshy skin along its claw, however should the player get close, U-8 will
        often attempt to strafe around the elevator.<\/p><p>Once enough damage has
        been done, it will eventually collapse onto the elevator with its mouth agape.
        This then gives the chance for players to unload at the mouth. Alternatively,
        players can throw a grenade down its throat (which triggers a small cutscene)
        to do maximum damage. Each grenade hurled in breaks apart of the armor covering
        U-8''s head, allowing more opportunities to do significant damage. U-8 attacks
        by performing long range slices with its claws, which''ll open a button prompt
        to help players avoid in time. It will also eventually summon a small array
        of flying insects to pester players and knock them off their aim when they''re
        shooting U-8''s weak points.<\/p><h3>Uroboros Mkono<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\"

        second helping of Uroboros comes courtesy of Excella Gionne, who once against
        attempts to halter Chris &amp; Sheva''s advance. Though unlike their first
        encounter, this one is much stronger and there are no conveniently placed
        furnaces nearby either. Instead players are given multiple gas canisters to
        drop, along with a flamethrower. The gas canisters, once dropped, will become
        melded with Uroboros should it move nearby one allowing the player to better
        maximise the fiery damage potential inflicted. The flamethrower is first stationed
        on the wall; it has limited ammo, and once used up must be returned so it
        can be refuelled.<\/p><p>Tactics for this encounter work pretty much the exact
        same as the last one and players must use the various fire-related weaponry
        at their disposal for Uroboros to reveal its weak points. The flamethrower
        using during the battle is strictly for this battle alone; once it''s finished,
        the player cannot take it with them.<\/p><h3>Albert Wesker &amp; Jill Valentine<\/h3><figure

        much travel and many B.O.W. creatures killed, Chris &amp; Sheva finally manage
        to catch up to Excella. However, Albert Wesker soon reveals himself to the
        duo along with a brainwashed Jill Valentine. Wesker finally decides to settle
        the score with Chris, and along with Jill, they have a two vs two battle inside
        an underground temple.<\/p><p>Despite the circumstances, Jill Valentine is
        not to be killed and it will result in a game over should that happen. She
        will have no qualms about attempting to kill the player, however. Albert Wesker
        of course shares the same philosophy. Ordinarily the player is to try and
        survive for seven minutes, though the player can also attempt to fight Wesker
        and should they do enough damage, Wesker will cut the current battle short
        and leave.<\/p><p>Albert Wesker because of his increased strength and agility
        is able to avoid nearly all weaponry fire, and can move about the environment
        considerably faster than the player. His choice of attack is to quickly charge
        in and use melee attacks against the player; sometimes he will also swiftly
        pull out his H&amp;K P8 and shoot two rounds at the player, though the player
        is given button prompts to avoid the shots. The most reliable strategy to
        beating Wesker during this stage is to run away; after so long has passed,
        or if the player heads near the door, Wesker will kick the player through
        it giving access to the upper floor and its corridors. From there the player
        can attempt to get some distance between them and Wesker, take cover, and
        then quickly pop out and shoot him. The same works if one player is able to
        distract him while another attempts to shoot his back.<\/p><p>Jill Valentine
        primarily uses her dual VZ61 submachine guns as she effortlessly scurries
        throughout the environment. It''s advised that one player attempts to keep
        her busy by throwing a flash grenade or the knife to stun her, then do a context-sensitive
        melee attack knocking her out temporarily. Despite her fondness for her submachine
        guns, she will still make use of her acrobatic abilities to attack the player
        should they get close enough.<\/p><p>Should the player manage to do enough
        damage, or if the seven minutes run out, Wesker leaves and the current battle
        ends. Though if the player manages to beat Wesker by inflicting too much damage,
        a unique treasure is then dropped within the area.<\/p><h3>Jill Valentine

        Albert Wesker has left, he then leaves it to the still brainwashed Jill Valentine
        to finish Chris &amp; Sheva after revealing the device on her chest that is
        the source of her behaviour. Jill functions much like she did during the previous
        battle against her and Wesker. She will scurry around almost like a wild animal--she
        will even hiss on occasion--while using her submachine guns and her athletic
        melee attacks to kill the player.<\/p><p>The player is a still not to kill
        Jill and must now attempt to use Chris'' voice to ''awaken'' Jill by using
        the A\/X (default 360\/PS3 controls) while avoiding her attacks; should the
        player be playing as Sheva in single-player, pressing A\/X will still automatically
        have Chris call out to Jill. Once Chris manages to temporarily get through
        to her, the device begins to malfunction giving the players time to try and
        rip the device off. Though when this happens, the player is given two possible
        choices on how to respond: The player can either use a melee attack, knocking
        Jill to the ground, and then attempt to pull off the device that way, or one
        player (or the AI) can grab a hold of Jill while the other player (or AI)
        can attempt to rip the device off.<\/p><p>The first option is more effective
        and will require less tries, though tearing off the device by using the second
        option will award the player with a trophy\/achievement.<\/p><h3>Uroboros

        was once the beautiful Excella Gionne, Albert Wesker''s betrayal has forced
        her to become a monstrously huge Uroboros creature. After absorbing a small
        mount of corpses, the third encounter with Uroboros quickly grows to the entire
        size of the ship cruiser. At first Chris &amp; Sheva retreat back into the
        ship during a small QTE sequence; once they arrive back inside the ship, the
        players only interaction with Uroboros is by avoiding its many surprise attacks.<\/p><p>Eventually
        they reach the back of the ship, and along with a portable Ion Cannon weapon
        do battle with the monster. First the player is to shoot the exposed bulbs,
        while avoiding its reactionary attacks via a button prompt, and after they''ve
        all been extinguished, the ''brain'' of the creature is exposed giving players
        the opportunity to use the Ion Cannon to shoot at it. All the while, Aheri
        will continuously spawn small Uroboros monsters; they''re relatively weak
        and should often be left as duty for the other player.<\/p><h3>Albert Wesker

        near a runway, Chris &amp; Sheva have finally caught up to Wesker and are
        planning to inject him with a serum that''ll neutralize the virus that enhances
        his strength and agility. Wesker still uses the same sort of attacks as he
        did when fighting against him previously, though the tactics for beating him
        have changed. Now players are to turn off the lights so as to stay hidden
        from Wesker; using an RPG, they are to then shoot at Wesker, who will often
        grab a hold of it just before it hits him, then shoot the rocket, and finally
        attempt to inject the serum.<\/p><p>It usually takes around 3-4 tries before
        it''s finally successful. Between each attempt, however, the player must find
        other rockets littered about the environment, and then the other player (or
        AI) must help reload it. After the first attempt, Wesker will then start throwing
        missiles at the player, but his usual array of attacks revolving around his
        enhanced agility are what fill out the most of his tactics.<\/p><p>A similar
        fight against Wesker also occurs at the end of the Lost in Nightmares story
        DLC that takes place during the flashback when Chris &amp; Jill are exploring
        Ozwell E. Spencer''s current residence. Though naturally he doesn''t have
        any missiles to throw. Like the battle against both Wesker &amp; Jill, this
        battle can either end two ways. Either the hidden timer will end, forcing
        the cutscene to trigger, or the player will be able to do enough damage that
        it will end prematurely. If players manage to beat Wesker by way of inflicting
        enough damage, they are awarded a trophy\/achievement.<\/p><h3>Albert Wesker

        final battle located within a volcano - Wesker has now allowed a containment
        of Uroboros to meld with his DNA, only this time Uroboros actually agrees
        with its host''s DNA. As such, Wesker has full control of his enhanced powers
        and abilities. His appearance is still altered, however, as the majority of
        his upper-body is enveloped in the traditional black tentacles that Uroboros
        is made of.<\/p><p>This fight goes through a small number of stages. First,
        the player is to run away until Chris &amp; Sheva are inadvertently split
        up. One player is then forced to keep on running while the other must gain
        Wesker''s attention from afar. Sheva will be running alongside a small pathway
        while Chris is further below. Reagardless of whom Wesker decides to follow,
        it''s up to the other to safeguard them while either: Sheva is attempting
        to climb back up after apart of the pathway crumbles beneath her feet, or
        while Chris is attempting to move a boulder out of his way. Then when both
        characters are reunited, the player is to lead Wesker up to a small hilltop.
        From there the ending battle begins.<\/p><p>Players are intended to shoot
        Wesker in his heart-like orifice which is initially exposed within his back.
        After enough shots, it will also become visible from his chest as well. Wesker
        attacks using his Uroboros arms as whips, while also attempting to grapple
        players; should a player be grabbed, they''ll need the assistance of their
        partner to escape.<\/p><p>To beat Wesker, players could simply follow the
        routine of shooting his heart. However, once Wesker is stunned, player''s
        can instead choose to run forward and initiate a QTE event showing Chris &amp;
        Sheva stab at his heart from both sides -- eventually resulting in the player
        winning the battle. Wesker is then ultimately killed when the player shoots
        him with an RPG launcher via a button prompt during the following cutscene.<\/p><h2>Unlockables<\/h2><p>Several

        by completing the main game on any difficulty, The Mercenaries is a classic
        Resident Evil <a href=\"\/minigames\/3015-116\" data-ref-id=\"3015-116\">mini-game<\/a>
        first introduced in Resident Evil 4. Based around arena combat, the player
        is to kill as many enemies as they can within the time limit; killing enemies
        within quick succession will start up a combo meter, which often leads to
        a substantial amount of points. Beginning with 2:00 minutes, the players can
        extend their time by locating the many time bonuses hidden throughout the
        map; any enemies killed via a melee attack will also reward the player with
        a 5 second bonus. Josh Stone acts as the announcer for both the beginning
        and ending of a Mercenaries match.<\/p><p>Leaderboards are available for players
        to show off their scores, and filters can be set to allow players to see their
        overall ranking worldwide, or to see how well they''ve done when compared
        against their friends.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/30\/917927-mercenaries_010.jpg\"

        of the time bonuses in the Public Assembly map<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>For
        each of the different maps, there exist mini-bosses taken from the main game
        who will appear sporadically. Such examples would be The Executioner for <i>The
        Public Assembly<\/i> and <i>Prison<\/i> maps, to the Chainsaw Wielding Majinis
        for the <i>Ship Deck<\/i> map. Killing these foes gains the player a sizeable
        point bonus, as well a 100% chance to drop some added supplies, be it a first-aid
        spray or some ammunition. Once a player''s health reaches the ''''dying''''
        state, they are to tap the O\/B (default PS3\/360 controls) quickly so they
        can regenerate their health back to its minimum.<\/p><p>Once time has run
        out, the player is then scored from D to SS (SS requiring above 90K) based
        upon their performance, which is graded on not only how many overall enemies
        the player killed, but also how high their combo meter reached. Should the
        player die, however, they are not given any rank and must try again.<\/p><h3>Cooperative

        can also be played with a friend, via online, split-screen, or even system-link.
        With another player, they can still make use of the same list of characters
        and can both even play as the same one should they choose. Because there are
        now two players, one player cannot tap O\/B to regenerate their health should
        they fall into the ''''dying'''' state, and will require the other player
        to heal them. Scores required to reach ranks are also doubled to account for
        the other player at hand as well.<\/p><p>Much like during the story, the player
        can use the O\/B button''s to call out for their ally, with various ad-libs
        depending on the situation. Each character has been fitted with their own
        unique dialogue as well - including Wesker, who will often shout out ''''Useless!''''
        should the other player perish in a 2-player round.<\/p><h3><b>Characters:<\/b><\/h3><table

        after the game''s initial launch. It features two game types: Slayers Mode,
        which is a \"point-based game that challenges players to kill Majinis,\" while
        Survivors Mode is the game''s take on deathmatch. 1v1 or 2v2 is available
        for both game types. The games are essentially the classic Mercenaries modes
        with team-based gameplay. The Slayers game mode lets players earn points for
        killing Majinis and other creatures.<\/p><p>The Survivors mode pits players
        against each other and they earn points for getting kills. While Majinis and
        other creatures will be present in this mode as well, players do not get points
        for killing them. <i>Versus<\/i> is the least popular of the DLC, given that

        &amp; Jill<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The Lost in Nightmares DLC is a 1-2 hour
        mini-campaign, playable in singleplayer or co-op. While it''s generally rather
        short, the game cannot be saved and must be completed in one go.<\/p><p>Lost
        in Nightmares follows Chris &amp; Jill during the BSAA mission glimpsed in
        flashback amidst the main campaign. Set in 2005, three years before Resident
        Evil 5''s story occurs, Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine are to infiltrate
        a mansion to locate <a href=\"\/ozwell-e-spencer\/3005-10018\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10018\">Ozwell
        E. Spencer<\/a>, the founder of the sinister Umbrella Corporation. The mini-campaign
        is deliberately reminiscent of the original <a href=\"\/resident-evil\/3030-5842\"
        data-ref-id=\"3030-5842\">Resident Evil<\/a>, with innumerable easter eggs
        and references. These include:<\/p><ul><li>Jill Valentine having to play moonlight
        sonata to open a secret passage within a wall.<\/li><li>Jill also having to
        lockpick a door.<\/li><li>An Itchy Tasty reference.<\/li><li>Cranks.<\/li><li>A
        remix of the original Resident Evil Save Room theme that plays over the results
        screen.<\/li><li>The ability to play the first third in the mansion with camera
        angles in place, should the player examine the entrance three times.<\/li><\/ul><p>Lost
        in Nightmares focuses heavily on puzzles over combat, with only one type of
        enemy across the story -- a new creature called the Guardian of Insanity,
        which is similar to the Executioner from Resident Evil 5''s campaign. However,
        multiple Guardians are encountered throughout; most are scripted to show up,
        however the very firsts appearance is random.<\/p><p>The player''s inventory
        from the main game cannot be transferred into Lost in Nightmare, and both
        Chris &amp; Jill will always begin with the same M92F pistols. Other weapons
        can be acquired within the mansion, although what weapons players will find
        are randomized. The list of weapons that can be found are but a fraction of
        what can be attained in the main game, however. A list of potential weapons
        the player may find is as such:<\/p><ul><li>M3 Shotgun<\/li><li>H&amp;K Handgun<\/li><li>S&amp;W
        Magnum Revolver<\/li><li>PSG1 Sniper Rifle<\/li><li>MP5 SMG<\/li><\/ul><p>The
        mini-campaign ultimately concludes with Jill and Chris fighting the ill-fated
        boss encounter with Wesker depicted in the flashback, which functions exactly
        like the default Wesker battle from the core game. Wesker can similarly be
        beaten by either surviving long enough to trigger the cutscene, or by dealing
        enough damage to end the fight prematurely.<\/p><p>BSAA emblems, similar to

        &amp; Josh<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The Desperate Escape DLC is another 1-2
        hour mini-campaign, this time focusing on the actions of Jill Valentine and
        Josh Stone immediately after the boss fight against a mind-controlled Jill.
        Jill and Josh must flee the TriCell Facility while Chris and Sheva pursue
        Wesker. Unlike Lost in Nightmares, Desperate Escape focuses almost entirely
        on combat, with players constantly being ambushed by Majini of all varieties
        as they make their way across all new environments. Though what enemies the
        player will face during a playthrough is randomized.<\/p><p>Like Lost in Nightmares
        the player''s inventory from the core game cannot be transferred over, and
        both Jill &amp; Josh begin with a pre-set inventory. Many more weapons and
        supplies can be procured in the field, though they are once again random.
        The same listing of weapons that can be found in Lost in Nightmares is the
        same here, only with the added chance of locating an RPG launcher.<\/p><p>It
        ends with a last stand, where Jill and Josh must defend themselves until a
        rescue helicopter comes to save them. This explains how they got their hands
        on one in time for the main campaign''s finale. Like Versus and Lost in Nightmares,
        Desperate Escape is playable in singleplayer or co-op, splitscreen or online,
        and costs $5 on Playstation Network or XBox Live Marketplace.<\/p><p>BSAA
        emblems can once again be found and shot to increase the player''s overall
        score.<\/p><p>The game became available for purchase on February 16, 2010
        on the Xbox Live platform Games on Demand for $29.99 USD. All three DLC packs
        were included in the new Resident Evil 5 Gold Edition.<\/p><h2>Mercenaries
        Reunion<\/h2><p>A remix of Resident Evil 5''s original Mercenaries minigame,
        Reunion is first made available should the player purchase the Lost in Nightmares
        pack or Desperate Escape pack, and is also packed within the Gold Edition
        of Resident Evil 5. All of the available characters are packed in as well,
        however should the player only purchase Lost in Nightmares or Desperate Escape,
        the roster list is cut in half. Because Reunion is a separate mode from the
        default Mercenaries mode, each set of characters is exclusive to each mode,
        disallowing the option for having Barry Burton and Albert Wesker team up in
        2-player for example.<\/p><p>Because the roles of Josh and Jill have been
        reversed (Josh now being playable while Jill is not), Jill is the announcer
        for Mercenaries Reunion.<\/p><h3><b>Characters - Lost in Nightmare Unlocks<\/b><\/h3><table

        original look from RE5''s debut teaser<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Resident
        Evil 5 was in development for 3 and a half years and approximately 121 people
        worked on the project.<\/p><p>Like most games, Resident Evil 5 went through
        innumerable revisions throughout development. It was initially developed to
        be a single-player game like Resident Evil 4 before it and zombies were once
        again the primary opponents the player would face. Other such revisions include
        Jill Valentine being Chris'' Partner instead of Sheva Alomar. Furthermore,
        even when planned as a single-player game, Jill would still appear in the
        game and could in fact permanently die during the story based upon a player
        choice. Sheva was always planned to star in the game one way or the other,
        only she was originally depicted as a member of a guerilla group instead of
        the BSAA.<\/p><p>Excella Gionne was to initially be featured in the game as
        a TriCell secretary as opposed to being the head of its West African division.
        What is now known as her role in RE5 was to be filled in by a male ''''CEO
        type character'''', to whom she and Wesker would betray, though only before
        Wesker would also ultimately betray Excella.<\/p><p>One notable mechanic that
        was removed mid-development was that of heat disorientation. Should the player
        have been wandering around out in the sun for too long, their character would
        start to become disorientated and would even begin to hallucinate. Players
        would then have to find some shade to take cover from the beating down sun
        and recuperate.<\/p><h3>Racism Controversy<\/h3><p>After the first full gameplay
        trailer was released during 2007''s E3, many interpreted the trailer depicting
        a lone white character (Chris Redfield) killing infected colored African Majini
        as to feature racist overtones. However the next trailer then showcased more
        common Majini varieties besides those of a dark complexion, including Caucasian
        and some that even look vaguely Spanish. Sheva Alomar, a West African native,
        was also confirmed to star as Chris'' partner during the very same trailer.<\/p><p>Resident
        Evil 5 producer <a href=\"\/masachika-kawata\/3040-32929\" data-ref-id=\"3040-32929\">Masachika
        Kawata<\/a> stated in response to the criticisms \"We can''t please everyone.
        We''re in the entertainment business \u2013 we''re not here to state our political
        opinion or anything like that. It''s unfortunate that some people felt that
        way.\" Lead producer <a href=\"\/jun-takeuchi\/3040-41365\" data-ref-id=\"3040-41365\">Jun
        Takeuchi <\/a>also expressed surprise at the complaints, and refuted any claims
        that the game was altered in any way as a reaction to the accusations.<\/p><h3>Demo<\/h3><p>On
        Friday, December 5th, 2008 a demo for the game was put on <a href=\"\/xbox-live-marketplace\/3045-86\"
        data-ref-id=\"3045-86\">XBLA<\/a> for Japan. Included in the demo are two
        stages, Shanty Town and District, which can be played either on solo, or via
        offline or online Co-op play, which is a highlighted new feature in Resident
        Evil 5. With some clever snooping on the Internet, one would have been able
        to acquire the demo for the 360 version of the game. For those who patiently
        waited, the 360 demo was released on January 26 via the Xbox Live Marketplace
        being exclusive to Gold Xbox Live members for a week. It was released on PS3
        via the Playstation Store a week later on February 2nd.<\/p><h2>Trivia<\/h2><ul><li>Jill
        coincidentally bears a somewhat close resemblance to <a href=\"\/fiona\/3005-2146\"
        data-ref-id=\"3005-2146\">Fiona<\/a>, the protagonist of the Capcom game <a

        is the first left-handed playable character in the Resident Evil franchise,
        and the camera is positioned over her left shoulder to compensate; in addition,
        her HUD is horizontally flipped from the other characters''. The reason for
        this is to create a more pleasing visual when playing the game in co-op split-screen
        mode.<\/li><li>Chris Redfield''s voice actor in RE5, <a href=\"\/roger-smith\/3040-4136\"

        data-ref-id=\"2300-319\">Resident Evil: Degeneration<\/a>.<\/i><\/li><li>During
        Chapter 1-1, should players let Chris &amp; Sheva go idle for a few minutes,
        this will then trigger a secret conversation between the two where they talk
        about elements of North American culture.<\/li><li>During development, the
        Uroboros creature was nicknamed ''Wriggles'' by the staff.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Soundtrack<\/h2><figure

        Evil features many ''gotcha'' moments<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Resident Evil
        is a classic survival horror game of the era, similar to the <a href=\"\/alone-in-the-dark\/3025-28\"
        data-ref-id=\"3025-28\">Alone in The Dark<\/a> series, mixing in third-person
        combat, exploration, and puzzles. Like most survival horror titles, Resident
        Evil limits the player character''s capabilities beyond the norm and ammunition
        for their firearms is generally scarce, intended to force players to use their
        supplies wisely and to choose flight rather than fight when possible.<\/p><p>While
        the game follows a linear pattern of major events, the player is allowed to
        explore most of the beginning mansion at will. Many of the puzzles and necessary
        key items required to move on can be solved\/collected in any order.<\/p><p>Utilising
        the notorious ''''<a href=\"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/tank-controls\/3015-4647\"
        data-ref-id=\"3015-4647\">tank controls<\/a>'''', players move via a third
        person perspective throughout a number of pre-determined camera angles. Characters
        also cannot move and fire their weapons at the same time, and instead the
        character will ''perch'' themselves to the ground when aiming.<\/p><p>The
        story is largely portrayed via in-game cutscenes, however there are also a
        number of Files (diaries, memos ect.) players can collect. These will often
        provide additional insight into the goings on across the overall narrative,
        but some are more vital as they will provide information pertaining to solving
        puzzles or maybe hinting as to where to go next.<\/p><h3>Playable Characters<\/h3><figure

        Chambers and Chris Redfield<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Resident Evil features
        two different characters--Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine--to select from.
        Each offers up a different take on the same narrative, though what separates
        them the most is the gameplay implications, as Jill Valentine''s version of
        the game is significantly easier and more accessible than Chris''.<\/p><p>Jill
        has more inventory space to carry items; she can potentially find an additional
        weapon exclusive only to her story, being the bazooka; she has with her a
        lockpick that can open locked drawers and doors that would ordinarily require
        the Sword Key; and many more such examples. Chris'' one primary benefit is
        that he is somewhat sturdier than Jill and can withstand more damage before
        succumbing to death.<\/p><p>Each character also has their own unique supporting
        character that they will often encounter and interact with during the game.
        Jill Valentine has with her fellow STARS Alpha team member Barry Burton, whereas
        Chris has the rookie medic of STARS Bravo team, Rebecca Chambers. Both Barry
        and Rebecca will sometimes have to help the player character from a perilous
        situation, though Barry will always be an NPC. During Chris'' story, however,
        players may take control of Rebecca Chambers on two separate occasions to
        help save Chris from dying of poison, and to kill the mutated plant monster
        Plant 42.<\/p><h3>Inventory<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\"

        Besides the character''s inventory, there also exist a number of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/item-box\/3055-6126\"
        data-ref-id=\"3055-6126\">item boxes<\/a> where players can store unwanted

        and items will persist throughout all item boxes across the game.<\/p><p>All
        items and weapons can be examined by the player, allowing them to get a closer
        look and turn the object around. This can sometimes change the properties
        of certain key items, such as unlocking\/opening a key item to reveal another
        inside, or may at least change the title to reflect the item''s true identity.<\/p><h3>Health

        the inventory menu, with an Electrocardiograph Machine showing a character''s

        character is in good-to-moderate health.<\/li><li><strong>Caution<\/strong>

        Herb<\/b> - On its own will restore 25% of health.<\/li><li><b>Blue Herb<\/b>

        destroyed.<\/p><h3>Alternate Endings<\/h3><p>Not only depending on which main
        character the player chooses, the endings of the game can also be determined
        by specific choices made throughout the game based on which characters manage
        to survive.<\/p><p>During Chris'' story, he can meet Rebecca chambers under
        a couple of different circumstances. The most common introduction is in the
        first floor medicinal save room. Once introductions are established, Rebecca
        asks Chris whether she can explore the mansion with him. If players choose
        yes, Rebecca won''t actually tag along with Chris but this will affect certain
        scenarios later on. If players choose no, she will reside within the save
        room and players can visit to have their health fully healed up to three times.<\/p><p>If
        players allowed her to travel freely in the mansion, whence returning after
        exploring the Residential building, Rebecca is forced into an encounter with
        a Hunter and screams for help; if the player can''t reach her quick enough,
        she will die. If she was told to wait in the save room, Rebecca is assured
        to survive. If she survives, then Rebecca will be able to set the bomb to
        destroy the mansion, triggering the resurgence of Tyrant on the Helipad.<\/p><p>Jill
        Valentine can also be left behind (and potentially killed for certain if Rebecca
        is still alive by that point) if the player isn''t able to find the 3 MO discs
        required to unlock the door to her cell, and vice versa when playing as Jill
        herself.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10354\/2716543-latest+%283%29.jpg\"

        betrayal<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>During Jill''s story, in order for Barry
        to survive players must establish a sense of ''trust'' with him. This is firstly
        done by waiting for him to ''get another rope'', during when Jill rappels
        down in the hole after killing Yawn. Afterwards, players will encounter Barry
        again in the underground caverns and he will ask to tag along with Jill. If
        Jill allows him to accompany her, this will then result in Barry returning
        to thwart Albert Wesker and safely escaping the mansion. If these requirements
        are not met, he will be found beaten and bloodied near the Umbrella Laboratory
        emergency escape and will die of his wounds. If Barry survives the encounter,
        which sets in motion the outcome of Wesker escaping and setting the Mansion
        to self-destruct, this triggers the ambush by Tyrant on the Helipad.<\/p><p>Overall
        there are technically eight endings in total dependant on which combination
        of characters managed to survive the Mansion Incident.<\/p><p><b>Chris'' Story<\/b>:<\/p><ol><li>Chris,
        Rebecca, and Jill survive; Albert Wesker is killed; the Spencer Mansion is

        with Tyrant.<\/li><\/ol><p><b>Jill''s story:<\/b><\/p><ol><li>Jill, Barry,
        and Chris survive; Albert Wesker escapes; the Spencer Mansion is destroyed.<\/li><li>Jill

        the Spencer Mansion is destroyed.<\/li><li>Jill survives; Albert Wesker is
        killed; the Spencer Mansion is left as it is along with Tyrant.<\/li><\/ol><p>The
        canon ending of Resident Evil is again made up of varying factors across both
        stories, including the survival of Chris, Jill, Barry, and Rebecca, the destruction
        of the Mansion, and the hatred Wesker grows for Chris.<\/p><h2>Weapons<\/h2><h3>Survival
        Knife<\/h3><p>Considered to be a last resort tactic, the knife does very little
        damage and has dangerously small reach. Because of its low effectiveness,
        it is usually best for the player to just run or attempt to avoid the enemy
        rather than combat it. Chris and Jill each wield their knife differently,
        though there are otherwise no differences speaking for their effectiveness.<\/p><h3>Handgun<\/h3><p>Jill
        Valentine''s starting handgun, which Chris Redfield also eventually procures
        as his pistol as he lost his in the forest. The beretta is the weapon of choice
        to handle lesser enemies such as zombies and Cerberus dogs.<\/p><h3>Shotgun<\/h3><p>A
        reliable pump-action shotgun. While it''ll ordinarily take three shots to
        kill a zombie, players can alternatively aim up and shoot when the zombie
        is close enough to destroy the head killing it completely. Acquiring the shotgun
        can differ slightly between Chris and Jill. Because collecting the shotgun
        will instigate the ceiling trap, Chris therefore requires the Broken Shotgun
        item to trade in its place. However Jill may potentially be able to collect
        it without the need for the Broken Shotgun.<\/p><p>Should Jill collect the
        shotgun, Barry will then arrive to save her from the trap. Though only if
        the player didn''t meet Barry prior when finding the corpse of Forest Speyer,
        otherwise Jill will then require the Broken Shotgun item.<\/p><h3>Colt Python<\/h3><p>An
        incredibly powerful magnum-revolver, most recognizable as Barry Burton''s
        weapon of choice. Simply massive in size, the Python is the second most powerful
        weapon in the game behind the Rocket Launcher. It can kill all lesser enemies
        with just one shot and is a reliable contender against boss battles. Though
        as one may expect, ammunition is terribly scarce.<\/p><h3>Bazooka<\/h3><p>A
        weapon exclusive to Jill Valentine, the Bazooka is a powerful and diverse
        weapon that has access to a small variety of grenade types. There are the
        regular explosive grenade rounds, which do a sizeable amount of damage against
        just about anything; flame rounds, which while powerful, are especially effective
        against such creatures as Plant 42; and acid, which is the most powerful variant
        and is especially useful against Hunters.<\/p><h3>Flamethrower<\/h3><p>Only
        find in Chris''s campaign, the flamethrower functions as both a weapon and
        a puzzle item, as the player requires it to trigger the unlocking of certain
        doors in the underground caverns. When used as a weapon, it''s decent at staving
        off Hunters as the continuous spray will cause the Hunter to rapidly flinch.
        Fuel quickly depletes, however, and no more can be found. A second flamethrower
        is also conveniently left outside the area where the player faces against
        the giant spider queen, Black Tiger. Once the player moves on from the underground
        sections, they cannot take the flamethrower with them as it is required to
        unlock the way out.<\/p><h3>Rocket Launcher<\/h3><p>Initially only available
        during the final encounter against the T-002 Tyrant, it can also be unlocked
        with infinite ammo if players complete the game under 3 hours. As one may
        expect, the Rocket Launcher is able to kill every enemy and boss (minus the
        Tyrant during the helipad fight) with a single shot.<\/p><h2>Enemies<\/h2><h3>Zombies<\/h3><figure

        staple of the older Resident Evil games, zombies are of course as prominent
        as ever in the original Resident Evil and make for the primary combatant .
        Slow and sluggish in movement, but dangerous up close, zombies are durable
        enough against gunfire that they can prove to be extremely dangerous even
        just in small numbers. When encountered on their own, however, zombies can
        be dispatched relatively easy so long as the player has enough ammunition
        to spare. As per usual, zombies are best dealt with the pistol or sometimes
        the shotgun, which can kill a zombie with a single shot if the player aims
        directly at its head once close enough, or can at least reduce the zombie
        to a literal crawl by destroying its legs.<\/p><p>Zombies attack by grabbing
        and biting the player when close, but will also puke out acid instead if they
        can''t quite reach the player. Some zombies will be encountered lying on the
        ground, seemingly pretending to be dead, and will grab at a character''s leg
        should the player get close enough. However, the leg bite does little damage
        and will always result in the character killing the zombie with a single stomp
        or kick. The sure way to note that a zombie, or any other enemy, is definitely
        dead is the pool of blood that forms from underneath the corpse.<\/p><p>Should
        a zombie fall to the ground and then proceeds to get back up, they will be
        completely invulnerable to all attacks during the animation period of such
        an action.<\/p><h3>Cerberus Dogs<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\"

        regular zombies, some sort of iteration surrounding infected dogs have persisted
        across nearly every Resident Evil game to date. Starting at the beginning,
        the Cerberus Dogs of Resident Evil are infected Doberman breeds, purposely
        engineered to be a form of B.O.W. Cerberus dogs retain the same agility and
        tenacity as a regular dog, though with a massive increase in aggressiveness,
        brutality, and stamina.<\/p><p>Like zombies, Cerberus dogs are best left for
        lesser weaponry like the pistols and shotguns. Running past is always an option
        as well, as both Chris and Jill are just ever so slightly faster than the
        canines.<\/p><h3>Crows<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\"

        hairy spiders, the Web Spinners are a tenacious foe across Resident Evil,
        though they primarily appear only briefly within the Residential building.
        They can crawl along walls like any other spider, and will often try to charge
        forward and bite players when given the opportunity. However, their greatest
        weapon is their poison spit, which they will routinely spray; it has a fairly
        long reach of attack and has a high chance of poisoning the player, though
        the base damage it inflicts isn''t quite as alarming.<\/p><p>Web Spinners
        have surprisingly tough hides and are most susceptible to the Bazooka - specifically
        when equipped with flame rounds. They will also often strafe once they''ve
        been shot and attempt to counter the player as such. If a Web Spinner is killed
        with its sack intact, a large multitude of baby spiders will seep out of the
        corpse and attack the player. Though their damage is even less than that of
        a crow and should the player leave the area, they will return to find them
        all gone.<\/p><h3>Hunters<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\"

        appearing once players return to the Mansion after investigating the Residential
        building, Hunters will then replace the common zombies of the game and will
        be encountered throughout in most areas where the zombies originally populated.
        Hunters are extremely dangerous and one of the most antagonising enemies throughout
        the franchise, let alone Resident Evil. They attack using their sharp claws
        and their most common source of attack is to leap through the air and slash
        the player; they are also invincible during the animation of leaping through
        the air. Their other attack is to simply slash at the player, though while
        the damage it does isn''t quite as dramatic as the leap, it can be difficult
        to avoid. The speed of the attack could also result in players consecutively
        falling prey to the attack.<\/p><p>Should the character''s health be in the
        Lime Green Fine state or lower, however, the Hunter''s leap will be replaced
        with a swift cleave which will decapitate the character killing them instantly.
        Hunters take one, sometimes two, shots from the Colt Python, which makes for
        the most suitable weapon. Otherwise the Bazooka, and even the shotgun, can
        do the job if there''s enough distance between the Hunter and the player.
        However Hunters are almost always encountered in groups of at least two.<\/p><h3>Chimera<\/h3><figure

        only within the secret underground laboratory, Chimera are wretched creatures
        made up of both human and fly DNA. Like Hunters, these too were artificially
        created by Umbrella themselves, though they apparently proved to be unreliable
        and not as effective as the Hunter B.O.W. They primarily function like a cross
        between Web Spinners and Hunters; Chimera''s can scuttle across flat surfaces,
        and will usually try to slash the player from above, but will also land into
        the floor and give chase. From this stage, Chimera''s may possibly leap onto
        the character''s back and slice them from there.<\/p><p>They can be relatively
        easy to avoid, however--especially if they''ve following whilst on the ceiling--and
        are rather weak as well, taking only around 2-3 shotgun rounds. Though much
        like the Hunters, Chimera are rarely encountered alone and they will sometimes
        attempt to swarm the player by attacking from two different directions.<\/p><h3>Adders<\/h3><figure

        often a large number of them at that. Running past them is the best option,

        monstrously huge snake that resides within an attic, Yawn will surface once
        the player enters in search of a crest. This battle is completely voluntary,
        however, as the player can attempt to just collect the crest and escape. Because
        of the snake''s size, this can sometimes prove difficult to maneuver throughout
        the environment. If the player is bitten there''s a high chance that they''ll
        be poisoned. If the player is poisoned, the character will pass out once they
        escape the room.<\/p><p>As Jill, she will pass out and fall to the ground,
        with Barry arriving soon after who will take her to the first floor save room.
        This is all done instantaneously amidst a black screen, however, and Jill
        will wake up to find Barry gone. As Chris, he too will pass out just as he
        leaves the area and will be greeted by Rebecca Chambers. However in this occurrence,
        the player may have to take control of Rebecca to then go and collect the
        serum from the first floor medicinal save room for Chris. This must be done
        within around 7 minutes, otherwise he will die and the game will be over.
        Rebecca may alternatively arrive and the game will fade to black, with Chris
        waking up in the first floor medicinal save room, though this is only if players
        tell Rebecca to stay in the save room as opposed to exploring the mansion.
        Fighting Yawn can be tricky because of its size, though it only takes four
        shots from the shotgun to force it to flee.<\/p><p>Yawn was named as such
        because of how it was said to resemble a yawn with the way its mouth opens
        as wide as it does.<\/p><h3>Yawn Part II<\/h3><p>Yawn will be faced a second
        and final time in the second floor room locked behind a Helmet Key lock. Inside
        is a blue piano, and upon investigating Yawn will slither out of the empty
        fireplace and attack, creating a hole in the floor in the process.<\/p><p>The
        battle functions much like the first bout, only this time Yawn must be killed
        and requires a considerable amount more punishment to beat. If the player
        is poisoned this time they are left to carry on without any assist. Though
        by this point blue herbs to cure the poison are now accessible and can be
        found throughout the mansion. Any of the damage inflicted on Yawn previously
        will have no effect for the second battle.<\/p><h3>Neptune<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\"

        begin to swim towards the player and attack. Though while the player character''s
        movement is subdued due to the knee high water, players could easily reach
        the room that''ll drain the tank while barely coming into contact with Neptune.<\/p><p>Once
        the tank has been drained Neptune and the other sharks will be left to flail
        about on the floor and are now completely harmless. Players can choose to
        mercy kill them--a single attack from any weapon will kill them--however it
        is not necessary. When encountered in the water the sharks are invincible.<\/p><p>For

        huge and incredibly hostile plant that has been infused with the T-Virus.
        Dubbed Plant 42 for being located within ''''Point 42'''', the carnivorous
        plant has entrenched itself within the Residential Building and uses its vines
        to attack its prey throughout the building via small holes in the floors,
        walls and ceiling. If the player nears any of these holes, the plant''s vine
        will attack and attempt to strangle the player until they waggle it off by
        mashing on the buttons. Once the body of the Plant has been located, this
        initiates the boss battle. Large in size, reaching the ceiling at around 12ft
        in height, it primarily attacks by using its vines to squirt small droplets
        of acid, though it will also attempt to attack the player by swiping them
        with its vines as well should they get close enough.<\/p><p>The best strategy
        is for the player to continually stay on the move to avoid the droplets of
        acid, while also taking some time to shoot the Plant in between. After enough
        damage, it will recede only to quickly sprout back out. As Jill, once this
        occurs Barry will arrive conveniently equipped with a flamethrower and will
        lay waste to the creature killing it. If players choose to first make the
        V-Jolt poison and administer it to Plant 42''s roots before hand, this will
        then automatically start the fight off in phase 2 during when Barry would
        ordinarily arrive.<\/p><p>As Chris, players may have to fight against Plant
        42 on their own until it''s killed, as Chris doesn''t know how to handle chemicals.
        However, if the player told Rebecca to stay in the medicinal save room, then
        as soon as Chris enters the room he will quickly be grabbed by the creature,
        just as Rebecca arrives on the scene. Chris will then throw her a file to
        help in creating the V-Jolt. Now controlling Rebecca, the player is to head
        to the nearby chemistry room and make the concoction. With the V-Jolt made,
        the player must then find the roots within the building located in the aqua
        tank and administer the V-Jolt, which will weaken Plant 42 as before, releasing
        Chris. Though this won''t have killed it completely and will still require
        the player to finish it off as Chris.<\/p><h3>Black Tiger<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\"

        gigantic tarantula, even by the giant spider standards of the game, the appropriately
        coined Black Tiger is colored in shades of black and grey. It functions like
        its smaller kin of spiders, though its poison spit is more ferocious and will
        actually shoot three splashes at once with a greater range. The environment
        is relatively small, which allows the player to run around the creature to
        keep out of its poison distance. The shotgun, Bazooka and magnum work as expected,
        though Black Tiger is especially weak to flame rounds. As Chris, the player
        will have a flamethrower available which can be effective, however its short
        range may prove to be a liability.<\/p><p>Once killed, a multitude of small
        spiders will begin to seep out of its corpse, though leaving the area and
        returning will remove them from the area.<\/p><h3>Tyrant T-002 Part I<\/h3><figure

        Wesker''s betrayal is revealed, he (or Barry, accidentally) will release Tyrant,
        where it will then proceed to slowly walk towards the player. The battle itself
        is relatively simple as it will only walk towards the player, though it won''t
        flinch against any gunfire. Keeping Tyrant at a safe distance, while circling
        the large lab equipment, the player should be able to down the monster without
        taking any damage so long as they have enough ammo. During this first fight
        Tyrant only requires four magnum shots to down.<\/p><p>For the Sega Saturn
        version, players must fight against two T-002 tyrants simultaneously.<\/p><h3>Tyrant
        T-002 Part II<\/h3><p>The final battle of the game, this second encounter
        with Tyrant is only triggered should the player have Barry or Rebecca alive,
        otherwise this battle will be skipped altogether and Brad Vickers will arrive
        to pick up the remaining characters.<\/p><p>Should the player''s supporting
        character be alive to set the self-destruct sequence, Tyrant will erupt from
        the ground on the heliport and its gameplay design has now been drastically
        altered. No longer content in steadily walking towards the player, Tyrant
        will now routinely break into a quick sprint and swipe with its massive claw
        at the player dealing a fair bit of damage, while also knocking them away
        a fair distance. After Tyrant has received enough damage, or the timer that
        is ticking down has reached around 20 seconds, Brad Vickers will drop down
        a rocket launcher the player must use to kill Tyrant. One shot is all it will
        take to kill it.<\/p><h2>Unlockables<\/h2><h3>Costumes<\/h3><p>Upon completing
        the game with the ''Happy'' Ending, which involves all three main characters
        surviving the story, players are gifted a special key for any following playthroughs
        with their completed save file. The key can be used to unlock a closet, located
        behind the locked Armour Key door in the main hall, which houses an additional
        costume for Chris and Jill.<\/p><h3>Weapons<\/h3><p>If players complete the
        game under 3 hours, they will find a rocket launcher with infinite ammo in
        their inventory for any following playthroughs with their completed save file.<\/p><p>For
        the Director''s Cut version, completing the game''s advanced mode regardless
        of the time will gift the player a Colt Python with infinite ammo in their
        inventory for any following playthroughs<\/p><h2>Development<\/h2><figure

        father of Resident Evil<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Resident Evil came about
        at the request of Capcom for <a href=\"\/shinji-mikami\/3040-32999\" data-ref-id=\"3040-32999\">Shinji
        Mikami<\/a> to develop a game set in a haunted house like their earlier Famicom
        title, <a href=\"\/sweet-home\/3030-15120\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15120\">Sweet
        Home<\/a>. Due to the popularity of shooters at the time, the original version
        of the game was in first person. Later, Capcom requested the game have a fixed
        camera style with a third person perspective like the earlier survival horror
        game, <a href=\"\/alone-in-the-dark\/3030-3102\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3102\">Alone
        in the Dark<\/a>.<\/p><p>Mikami originally wanted Resident Evil to be a game
        about fighting ghosts but he decided to make it into a zombie game instead,
        thinking it would be much more exhilarating than fighting with evil spirits.
        For the first six months of development, he worked on the game on his own
        without anyone''s assistance. Mikami managed to increase the workforce by
        fifteen personnel and from that time on, the team gradually increased in number
        until, towards the end of development, he had more than fifty people working
        on the game. Among those people were <a href=\"\/hideki-kamiya\/3040-60123\"
        data-ref-id=\"3040-60123\">Hideki Kamiya<\/a>, <a href=\"\/hiroki-katoh\/3040-40596\"
        data-ref-id=\"3040-40596\">Hiroki Kato<\/a>, <a href=\"\/jun-takeuchi\/3040-41365\"
        data-ref-id=\"3040-41365\">Jun Takeuchi<\/a>, Motoi Fujita, Ippei Masuda,
        Yasuhiro Anpo, <a href=\"\/katsutoshi-karatsuma\/3040-60064\" data-ref-id=\"3040-60064\">Katsutoshi
        Karatsuma<\/a>, <a href=\"\/kiyohiko-sakata\/3040-60060\" data-ref-id=\"3040-60060\">Kiyohiko
        Sakata<\/a> and Ippo Yamada.<\/p><p>The development was a shaky process and
        Capcom showed little faith in Mikami''s game. Thinking it would not sell well,
        Capcom decided to cancel the project but Mikami defended it hard until they
        decided not to. In the end, Resident Evil sold really well and became a household
        name throughout the western world, much to Mikami''s surprise.<\/p><p>During
        the concept stage of development, Resident Evil was originally intended to
        be a co-op game, but due to technological constraints it was not possible
        at the time. Some of the elements that were originally intended for co-op
        eventually became the zapping system in Resident Evil 2, and to a more advanced
        extent Resident Evil 0.<\/p><h2>Soundtrack<\/h2><p>The soundtrack, titled

        multi-player installment to the horror franchise, Resident Evil: Outbreak
        challenged gamers to team up with three others online in an attempt to escape
        the T-Virus and Raccoon City.","description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><p>Resident
        Evil: Outbreak is a survival horror game that adheres to many conventions
        set forth by its genre, but brings online play into the mix. The game offered
        simultaneous online play for up to four players, with eight differing, balanced
        characters--each with abilities and specifications all their own. The game
        itself takes place during the same time span as <a href=\"\/resident-evil-2\/3030-9418\"
        data-ref-id=\"3030-9418\">Resident Evil 2<\/a> and <a href=\"\/resident-evil-3-nemesis\/3030-5587\"
        data-ref-id=\"3030-5587\">Resident Evil 3: Nemesis<\/a> in Raccoon City--even
        featuring a number of familiar locales to series veterans. A sequel, <a href=\"\/resident-evil-outbreak-file-2\/3030-15222\"
        data-ref-id=\"3030-15222\">Resident Evil: Outbreak File #2<\/a>, was released
        only a year later. The game was also one of the very few PlayStation 2 titles
        to utilize the hard-drive add-on. By installing game information on it prior
        to playing, load times would be decreased significantly.<\/p><p>The Online
        functionality of the game was unavailable in European territories, forcing
        European players to play with the AI. However the sequel belatedly introduced
        Online for all. <\/p><h2>Plot<\/h2><p>The game begins only two days following
        the <a href=\"\/t-virus\/3015-42\" data-ref-id=\"3015-42\">T-Virus<\/a> arriving
        in <a href=\"\/raccoon-city\/3035-73\" data-ref-id=\"3035-73\">Raccoon City<\/a>.
        The story picks up with our initial eight characters in a fated bar just as
        the situation escalates beyond all control. Although all of the five scenarios
        are at least somewhat relevant to the overall plot, they are not specifically
        interrelated to one another.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>The game was played
        much like previous Resident Evil titles, but with a more dynamic character
        and a slightly more novice-friendly control scheme. Offline play was available,
        which usually added two specific AI partners to interact and assist your chosen
        character throughout each scenario. The online play allowed for play with
        three others, with each of the players choosing one of eight possible characters.
        Each player is subject to the virus meter throughout any of the scenarios.
        The virus meter measures the character''s susceptibility to the rampant T-Virus
        that''s overtaking the remaining Raccoon citizens, and continually rises as
        time goes on. While this does inhibit the exploration factor, it does ensure
        that all players are on track and all striving to complete each scenario in
        time. Healing items can effectively stall the meter for a short time, and
        as it culminated, players would be killed. Players who die are reanimated
        in the form of computer-controlled zombies which then attack the other players;
        watching yourself become a zombie is the game''s equivalent of a ''game over''.<\/p><p>The
        foundation of the game is based on progressing through the five scenarios,
        one by one. Each scenario allows the players to investigate more of the T-Virus
        outbreak, and are all canonical to the overall mythos. Some environments and
        locations are taken expressly from the second and third games, with only passing
        references in other situations.<\/p><p>Much of the replayability of the game
        involved a mesh of altering the difficulty level and utilizing the Checklist
        system. The available difficulty levels in the game challenged players by
        limiting supplies drastically with each step up, and even changing the amount
        of weapons available. Experiencing certain events and satisfying certain conditions
        allowed players to complete each scenario''s Checklist, which would eventually
        unlock \"Infinity Mode\"--a mode which allowed gameplay to run undeterred
        with unbreakable weapons and unlimited ammunition.<\/p><h2>Online Play<\/h2><p>The
        network mode of the game featured broadband-only access for up to four players
        taking on the undead. Some of the more obvious exclusions from online play
        was the lack of voice chat functionality and text chat in-game. Some believed
        the lack of these added a more engaging aspect to the game, while others claimed
        it was an obvious mistake to not include the features. It should be noted
        that text chat was still available in pre-game chat rooms and lobbies.<\/p><p>After
        creating an account and logging into the game, two options were available:
        Scenario Mode and Free Mode. Scenario Mode is considered a matchmade process,
        where the scenario and players are chosen at random and would begin at the
        first scenario of the game. Free Mode allowed players to join lobbies in order
        to organize players and play under their own specifications.<\/p><p>The North
        American online servers for the game ceased operation on December 31st, 2007.<\/p><h2>Characters<\/h2><p>The
        game featured eight characters, each with diverse capabilities and uses. Every
        character began with a unique starting item, as well as having special physical
        abilities.<\/p><h3><a href=\"\/kevin-ryman\/3005-1568\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1568\">Kevin

        passages and uncover supply depots. She has an offensive side as well, with
        her sharing the \"Take Pot-Shots\" ability with Kevin. Her defense is more
        oriented toward evasion than anything due to her ability to quickly back step
        from enemies.<\/p><h3><a href=\"\/jim-chapman\/3005-1574\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1574\">Jim

        Escape<\/p><p><b>Overview<\/b>: Yoko is adept with computers and puts this
        trait to use in due time. Her most enduring feature, though, is her ability
        to carry four extra items via her backpack. Should she find herself in a swarm
        of enemies, she can escape by quickly stepping away.<\/p><h2>Scenarios<\/h2><p>The
        game was comprised of five base scenarios, each fully fledged stories of their
        own. They all were composed of differing environments, some of which were
        new to the series and some of which had been featured in past installments.<\/p><h3>Outbreak<\/h3><p>The
        scene is set with all of the eight primary characters present at J''s Bar
        in downtown Raccoon City. Suddenly, things go awry when the threat of the
        T-Virus epidemic becomes clear and patrons begin to feast on one another.
        It''s up to the survivors to work together to escape the bar and find shelter.<\/p><h3>Below
        Freezing Point<\/h3><p>The group now finds themselves in the underground laboratory
        from the climax of Resident Evil 2. A mysterious woman by the name of Monica
        with a previous connection to Yoko is here ahead of the group. She steals
        Yoko''s access card, forcing players to take an alternate route to escape
        from the laboratory.<\/p><h3>The Hive<\/h3><p>After seeking refuge at the
        hospital, everything seems to be fine--at first. A doctor by the name of Hursh
        Walks introduces himself to the survivors and offers his help, but still expressing
        his desire to leave. After attempting to activate the elevator, he is attacked
        and killed by a monstrous enemy the group never expected: The Leechman. Their
        only option is to proceed through the hospital and into the sewer...<\/p><h3>Hellfire<\/h3><p>Firemen
        are attempting to dowse a fire at a local hotel. The group has found their
        way in, but now must find their way out of the hotel, while avoiding the dreaded
        Lickers, and something even more horrible than they ever imagined; it seems
        the infection has spread far wider than they ever expected.<\/p><h3>Decisions,
        Decisions<\/h3><p>Everything comes to a head as the group finds their way
        to Raccoon City University, where they hope to learn the truth behind the
        virus. What has drawn them here is a letter from George''s old comrade Peter
        Jenkins, who says he has \"vital information\" on the crisis that only he
        can understand. An old face from Resident Evil 3: Nemesis appears, and it
        seems their activities during that game were not quite as limited as it once
        seemed...<\/p>","expected_release_day":null,"expected_release_month":null,"expected_release_quarter":null,"expected_release_year":null,"id":576,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/8\/87790\/1867817-box_reo.png","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/87790\/1867817-box_reo.png","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/8\/87790\/1867817-box_reo.png","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/87790\/1867817-box_reo.png","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/8\/87790\/1867817-box_reo.png","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/8\/87790\/1867817-box_reo.png","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/8\/87790\/1867817-box_reo.png"},"name":"Resident

        structure of Revelations 2 is made up of two separate stories. First is with
        Claire and Moira after they''ve been kidnapped by unknown forces and must
        try to find a way off the island they were taken to. The second follows Barry
        Burton and Natalia Korda as they retread the steps of the aforementioned two
        in the hopes of finding them. Each episode of the main four includes one segment
        per pair, starting with Claire\/Moira and ending on Barry\/Natalia.<\/p><p>There
        are three difficulty settings available by default: Casual, Normal, and Survivor.<\/p><p>A
        third-person shooter with an over-the-shoulder perspective, Revelations 2
        shares the same shooter-style controls of the original Revelations'' HD version,
        allowing players to more traditionally move and shoot. The dodge maneuver
        returns, only it can now be utilized at any time rather than functioning as
        an invisible QTE just before an enemy would attack. The ability to crouch
        has been added, so as to allow players to sneak past enemies or perform stealth
        kills on any enemies that have their back turned to the player; it also helps
        steady the player''s aim. The sprint from Resident Evil 6 returns, which is
        the sole new mechanic of RE6 to make a reappearance in Revelations 2, however
        players can''t sprint forever. After so long the player character will become
        tired, which will temporarily slow down their natural movement speed and make
        it harder to aim until the character regains their breath. Many of the enemies
        attacks can potentially hurt others enemy by mistake if they''re within the
        vicinity; this thusly allows players to potentially steer enemies into attacking
        and ''thinning the herd''.<\/p><p>By default players must aim their weapons
        with a generic crosshair, however there exists an option for players to change
        the crosshair to the classic laser-sight, complete with a small selection
        of colors to choose from: red, blue, green, and white.<\/p><h3>Cooperative

        most notable addition to Revelations 2 from its predecessor is the inclusion
        of cooperative gameplay for the story, though it is restricted to local, split-screen
        co-op only (except in the PC version, where not even local co-op is available,
        and the game is single-player-only). Revelations can also be played in single-player
        as well, with the player able to switch between both characters instantaneously
        akin to the partner system in <a href=\"\/resident-evil-zero\/3030-10247\"
        data-ref-id=\"3030-10247\">Resident Evil Zero<\/a>.<\/p><p>Even with the inclusion
        of co-op it still differs from the likes of Resident Evil 5, as each of the
        two main playable characters, Claire and Barry, have their own supporting
        character -- Moira Burton and Natalia Korda respectively.<\/p><p>When playing
        in single-player, only Claire\/Barry dying will result in a game over. While
        Moira\/Natalia can still be downed, this won''t end the game and the character
        will instead simply stay out of commission until the player can revive them.<\/p><h3>Playable
        Characters<\/h3><h4>Claire Redfield &amp; Barry Burton<\/h4><p>Claire &amp;
        Barry each play like a traditional Resident Evil protagonist and handle much
        of the combat. They can each do a melee attack against a stunned enemy, typically
        by shooting them in the head like in previous games; players are also once
        again invulnerable whilst performing a prompted melee attack. They can equip
        up to four weapons at a time and can switch between them all with the directional-pad,
        with each direction representing a different weapon slot. They each also have
        access to a knife which they can swipe at will with the R2\/RT button (default
        PS4\/XB1 controls).<\/p><h4>Moira Burton<\/h4><p>Moira is Claire''s supporting
        character and cannot use any firearms. She will instead primarily utilise
        her flashlight to blind enemies, allowing Claire to then potentially rush
        in and perform a melee attack; the flashlight can also be used to discover
        hidden supplies that otherwise couldn''t be collected by Claire, much like
        how the Genesis scanner functioned in the original Revelations. Despite her
        aversion to firearms Moira isn''t completely defenseless, as she comes equipped
        with a crowbar for use as a melee weapon, which she can also use to enact
        a stealth takedown on an unsuspecting enemy or to execute a downed one. If
        she has any in her inventory, Moira can also throw sub-weapons as well.<\/p><h4>Natalia
        Korda<\/h4><p>Natalia is Barry''s supporting character and like Moira cannot
        use any firearms. Natalia shares some of Moira''s abilities while having some
        of their own. She too can locate hidden supplies in the environment via a
        <a href=\"\/detective-mode\/3015-6244\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6244\">special
        kind of vision<\/a>; having Natalia point at the glinting item will then allow
        it to be collected. However the vision will also allow her to spot any nearby
        enemies or traps, and in the case of the ''Revenant'' enemy will pinpoint
        its critical weak point. Crouching will increase the effectiveness of her
        vision, allowing her to spot enemies from greater distances.<\/p><p>While
        Natalia doesn''t have access to a weapon, she can pick up bricks and then
        either throw it at an enemy, or smash over the head of an enemy residing on
        the floor. Bricks aren''t indestructible and will soon break after continued
        use.<\/p><h3>Health &amp; Bleeding<\/h3><p>Players have no formal way of reading
        their character''s health and must instead note the screen itself. For the
        PS4 version the player''s health is at least visualized via the controller''s
        light; green notes full health, followed by yellow, orange, and red.<\/p><p>As
        players take more damage the screen will begin to redden, which will cover
        more and more of the screen the more damage the character sustains. If their
        health gets too low the character''s overall movement speed will slow down
        and they will have much more difficulty in keeping a steady aim with weapons.
        Characters will regenerate their health up to the point where they will at
        least escape the phase that slows down their movement and hinders their accuracy.
        Though to recover fully players must use a herb; using the herb also takes
        some preparation and players must wait until their character has filled a
        can of first aid spray with the herb first before it will be administered.
        A bar will show up on screen to visualize the time it takes for the character
        to use the herb. There are red herbs players can find alongside green; mixing
        a red and a green herb will result in three green herbs.<\/p><p>What''s new
        over the original is the concept of bleeding, where certain attacks can cause
        either character to bleed, which will remove their ability to sprint and slowly
        cause continuous damage. It will visually blot the screen with drops of blood
        as well. If either character has a tourniquet, they can then use that to halt
        the bleeding; simply using a herb, while will still heal the character, cannot
        stop the bleeding.<\/p><p>Similar to the effects of bleeding, the screen will
        sometimes become filled with a sort of mucus. This typically comes about from
        being within the vicinity of a Sploder''s explosion. The mucus will cover
        the majority of the screen for a short while; it will dissipate on its own,
        though players can also instead use Disinfectant to remove the mucous instantaneously.
        If the player''s supporting character has available a tourniquet or a disinfectant,
        they will use it automatically on the other player should they be bleeding
        or their screen is covered in mucus.<\/p><h3>Inventory<\/h3><p>Both Claire\/Barry
        and Moira\/Natalia have their own inventory menu, however whereas Claire\/Barry
        can carry up to ten items, Moira\/Natalia can only carry five. There are inventory
        packs players can find to increase each of the character''s inventory. Items
        in each character''s inventory can be traded between the two regardless of
        the distance. Bringing up the inventory screen will not pause the game.<\/p><h3>Sub-Weapons
        &amp; Crafting<\/h3><p>What Revelations 2 calls ''sub-weapons'' are the grenades
        of the game. They are accessed with L1\/LB and from there the player must
        press the required face button to throw a grenade. Like with primary weapons,
        players can carry up to four different grenade types at once, one per face
        button.<\/p><p>A simple crafting system has been included and allows players
        to mix together certain resources to build their own grenades, tourniquets
        or disinfectant.<\/p><p>Items that can be crafted are as such:<\/p><ul><li><strong>Explosive
        Bottle:<\/strong> Gunpowder + Empty Bottle.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><strong>Firebomb
        Bottle:<\/strong> Alcohol + Empty Bottle.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><strong>Decoy
        Bottle:<\/strong> Odorous Chemical + Empty Bottle.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><strong>Smokescreen
        Bottle:<\/strong> Smoke Powder + Empty Bottle.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><strong>Tourniquet:<\/strong>
        Cloth + Green Herb.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><strong>Disinfectant:<\/strong> Cloth
        + Alcohol.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><strong>Three Green Herbs:<\/strong> Red Herb
        + Green Herb.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Weapon Upgrades<\/h3><p>As in the original Revelations,
        weapons are upgraded via ''Parts'', which can be used to improve and modify
        a weapon''s properties, such as damage, reload speed, capacity ect. In the
        story they can be found throughout the environment or potentially unlocked,
        though they can only be fitted onto a weapon via a workbench, which are located
        at key points per episode. Only one of each type can be fitted to a weapon,
        meaning players can''t attach multiple ''Damage'' parts to a single weapon.<\/p><h3>Collectables<\/h3><p>There
        are a vast number of collectables throughout the game across four different
        categories:<\/p><h4>Tower Emblems<\/h4><p>These are hidden throughout the
        environment and must be shot. Should both Claire and Barry be exploring the
        same environments amidst the episode, the emblems won''t need to be shot again
        by the other character. Emblems that have already been shot are colored white,
        whereas they''re ordinarily blue.<\/p><h4>Military\/Gimmick Boxes<\/h4><p>These
        are boxes that only Moira\/Natalia can open. Though despite their differing
        names and appearances, they still require the same method to unlock. Players
        are to try and locate the unlock points within the circle; using either of
        the analogue sticks, players can search with their own smaller circle to locate
        the points. The circle will be a light color to signify when they''re close
        to an unlock point, and will be red otherwise, while holding down R2\/RT will
        make the circle slowly shrink as it homes in on the unlock point.<\/p><p>The
        amount of unlock points the player must find varies per box, differing between
        one to four.<\/p><h4>Kafka Drawings<\/h4><p>These are exclusive to Claire''s
        segments as they require Moira to use her flashlight to locate them. Plastered
        on walls or the ceiling, Kafka Drawings are colored blue and will only appear
        under the light of Moira''s flashlight. Whence found Moira needs to aim her
        flashlight at the drawing for a couple of seconds for it unveil itself completely
        and count as being found.<\/p><h4>Insect Larvae<\/h4><p>These are exclusive
        to Barry''s segments as they require Natalia''s special vision to locate them.
        Insect Larvae are noted with a red aura when using Natalia''s vision, usually
        located on walls, and must then be killed whence located for it to count.<\/p><h3>Medals<\/h3><p>Each
        segment per Episode has its own set of in-game achievements. They each contribute
        towards the overall BP bonus at the end, though they don''t all need to be
        attained within a single playthrough. When playing through an Episode players
        can check what Medals they haven''t already achieved in the pause menu under
        Records.<\/p><p>A list of the Medals per Episode segment is as such:<\/p><h4>Episode

        the Overseer. Claire, Moira and Pedro then head to the bar to turn off the
        siren, however upon doing so they''re trapped by the onslaught of attacking
        Afflicted. The three are able to hold them at bay, however Pedro panics and
        reaches the point to where the virus takes effect, as Pedro rapidly transforms
        into a huge, monstrous creature right then and there in the bar. Wielding
        a drill he had found before hand, he now utilises it as a melee weapon against
        Claire and Moira. The duo are able to escape the bar and climb to the roof
        thanks to the assistance of another Terra Save member called Neil who arrives
        shortly after they escape the bar. He briefs them about the nearby tower that
        is likely where the Overseer resides and that they should thusly attempt to

        a building and emerging on the other side onto a road, they spot Gabe above
        flying the helicopter. However the Oversee then remotely short circuits the
        controls, while Gabe himself begins to transform much like Pedro before him.
        The helicopter ultimately crash lands into the side of a building killing

        listing the Terra Save members that were captured, to which she then comes
        to the realization that Neil had sold them out. They soon enter what looks
        to be a sort of missile silo, as they watch an elevator descend. Neil then
        exits the elevator and rapidly begins to mutate, turning into a giant, ogre-like
        monster. Both Claire &amp; Moira work together to kill Neil, however after
        feigning defeat he attacks Claire knocking her gun away. Moira is then forced
        to go against her morals concerning guns, picks up Claire''s pistol, and kills
        Neil.<\/p><p><strong>Barry &amp; Natalia<\/strong><\/p><figure data-align=\"left\"

        confronted by the now monstrous Alex Wesker, Barry is able to cause a distraction
        by shooting some loose rubble from above, allowing them to escape amidst the
        chaos. Natalia however is mildly injured and requires Barry to carry her.
        As Barry slowly escorts Natalia until she feels better to walk herself, he
        reveals the event about Moira and how she had accidentally shot her younger

        finally confront the Overseer, Alex Wesker. Meanwhile Alex monologues about
        her plan to transfer her mind into Natalia Korda-- due to an illness Alex
        is slowly dying from--who is being sent downward in a parallel elevator for
        protection as it will take six months for it to take affect. Upon reaching
        the top and reading some of Alex''s notes, Claire and Moira discover that
        the entire experiment was so Alex could find a suitable candidate, one who
        feels no fear and can therefore withstand the procedure. Due to the traumatic
        event of Natalia watching her parents die in Terragrigia, she has lost the
        capacity to feel any fear, making her perfect for Alex''s plan.<\/p><p>The
        two finally encounter Alex on the other end of bulletproof glass. After some
        ramblings of her desire to become a God, she then ''''frees'''' herself by
        shooting herself in the head. The upper half of the tower then begins a self-destruct
        sequence, forcing Claire and Moira to flee. Whilst making their way down through
        the wreckage, rubble begins to descend towards Claire, only Moira is able
        to quickly push her out of the way to avoid the rubble and take her place.
        Trapped underneath the rubble, Moira pleads Claire to continue on and escape
        without her. Claire reluctantly does so and leaps off of the tower into the
        ocean below.<\/p><p><strong>Barry &amp; Natalia<\/strong><\/p><figure data-align=\"left\"

        is shown having a dream wherein he finds Claire at a hospital and asks where''s
        Moira. Amidst tears, Claire tells Barry she''s sorry as she''s taken away
        on the gurney to have her wounds treated. Barry then wakes up to find Natalia
        staring at him, with a concerned look on her face. He dispels her concern
        and the two carry on their search of Alex Wesker. Natalia then mentions that
        she thinks Alex is down below in an underground facility, yet she doesn''t
        know why she remembers this. The two thusly make their way downward, crossing
        a rather broken bridge, making their way through a gas-encased mine, until
        ultimately arriving at Alex''s mansion. Reading more of Alex''s notes reveals
        that she underwent her monstrous transformation because she didn''t entirely
        die when she shot herself, and the fear of dying thusly triggered the T-Phobos
        virus within her.<\/p><p>Her monstrous appearance has resulted in Alex''s
        mental state dropping even further and is now terrified of her own appearance,
        explaining her fearful outburst upon seeing her reflection in Natalia''s eyes.
        She also holds a lot of animosity towards Natalia, thinking that she is the
        ''''false'''' Alex. Barry &amp; Natalia are eventually able to locate Alex
        deeper within the mansion in her lab. However just before they arrive Alex
        injects herself with a vial of Uroborus, forcing her to undergo another mutation.
        Now taking to the offensive, Barry fights against the even more monstrous
        Alex Wesker while she continues to ramble and mutter incessantly about being
        the ''''true Alex''''. However Alex is able to catch Barry off-guard, knocking
        him aside, and then picks up Natalia. Just before she can kill Natalia, Moira
        Burton arrives and shoots Alex enough so that she drops Natalia. Barry &amp;
        Moira share a short reunion, but only before the three are forced to flee
        from Alex who has undergone another mutation, changing her skin pigment to
        a charcoal black. Upon arriving at a cliffside, a helicopter ascends from
        below with Claire Redfield onboard equipped with a sniper rifle. Barry places
        Moira &amp; Natalia onboard while he stays on the ground to face against Alex
        Wesker; Claire provides backup sniper fire from the helicopter.<\/p><figure

        to her with a well-placed RPG shot. He then gets onto the helicopter, as BSAA
        helicopters whizz past to clean up the island. Barry and Moira bury the hatchet
        and their relationship is repaired and better than it''s ever been due to
        the ordeal. Finally, when Claire asks what Barry will do now, he happily states
        he''s ''''going back to being a father'''' as he puts an arm around Natalia,
        who responds with a joyous smile in return.<\/p><h4><strong>Epilogue<\/strong><\/h4><p>Claire
        is shown driving to meet with Moira at the Burton household with a gift; mention
        of her brother <a href=\"\/chris-redfield\/3005-413\" data-ref-id=\"3005-413\">Chris

        as well as the <a href=\"\/tall-oaks\/3035-4031\" data-ref-id=\"3035-4031\">Tall
        Oaks<\/a> outbreak of RE6 also.<\/p><p>At Barry''s house, Moira and Barry
        are getting ready to meet Claire, while Natalia is shown upstairs in her room
        reading out loud the Franz Kafka aphorism: ''''A cage went in search of a
        bird. But now the bird is gone. The bird has changed.'''' before revealing
        a smirk, suggesting that Alex Wesker was able to successfully incorporate
        her mind into Natalia''s body.<\/p><h4><strong>Alternate Ending<\/strong><\/h4><p>During
        Episode 3 amidst the Monster Neil fight, the player is given the choice to
        finish Neil either as Claire or Moira. If Moira kills him the game ends as
        detailed above, however if Claire is the one to do it, Moira is shown to die
        from under the debris during the end of Claire''s segment in episode 4. Thusly,
        without Moira to intervene, Alex is able to ''kill'' Natalia allowing her
        conscience to be taken over by ''Alex''. From there Natalia kills the monster
        Alex by effortlessly ripping out her heart. Barry points his gun at the Natalia-Alex
        hybrid pleading not to make him have to shoot her, however Natalia-Alex turns
        around and begins to laugh knowing that Barry won''t have the heart to shoot
        her; she then walks away into the darkness while Barry slumps to the floor.<\/p><h2>Weapons<\/h2><h3>Combat
        Knife<\/h3><p>Claire and Barry''s melee weapon, which is permanently equipped
        and can be utilized with the press of the R2\/RT button. Both characters use
        the knife the same way with short-range swipe attacks; the damage is minimal,
        though the speed by which they attack can lend itself to finishing an enemy
        off after it''s been softened up with gunfire. Whence upgraded with the related
        Skills the knife can prove to be a formidable weapon.<\/p><h3>Crowbar<\/h3><p>Moira
        Burton''s exclusive melee weapon. It shares the same controls as the knife,
        however it functions slightly differently as it''s slower but more powerful.
        The crowbar from the outset can be used to enact a ''follow-up'' attack on
        a downed enemy, whereas for Claire\/Barry they first require a Skill upgrade.<\/p><h3>Flashlight<\/h3><p>Moira''s
        other exclusive piece of equipment. The flashlight can be used to not only
        help players search the environment, but to also potentially stun enemies.
        When shone directly at an enemy for long enough they will cover become stunned,
        allowing Claire to then perform a melee attack. Barry too has a small pocket
        light, however his is only used for visual aid rather than any sort of combat
        assistance.<\/p><h3>Handgun MPM<\/h3><p>The beginning handgun that Claire
        soon procures early in the first episode. The MPM is one of the weakest weapons
        in the game, although it at least has the fastest rate of fire and can equip
        the most parts amongst the pistols.<\/p><ul><li>Part Slots: 5<\/li><li>Default
        Ammo Count: 9<\/li><\/ul><h3>Handgun P10<\/h3><p>An alternate handgun that
        Claire can eventually acquire. The P10 is superior to the MPM in nearly every
        respect, with its one main drawback being that it can''t equip as many parts.<\/p><ul><li>Part
        Slots: 3<\/li><li>Default Ammo Count: 14<\/li><\/ul><h3>Handgun Samurai Edge<\/h3><p>Barry''s
        own personal custom pistol from his days as a S.T.A.R.S. officer, the Samurai
        Edge is the most powerful handgun in the game and is well balanced across
        all facets with no significant weaknesses.<\/p><ul><li>Part Slots: 5<\/li><li>Default
        Ammo Count: 9<\/li><\/ul><h3>Machine Pistol-AB50<\/h3><p>A fast-firing machine
        pistol exclusive to Claire. Each individual shot from the MP-AB50 is weak,
        however its rate of fire more than makes up for it. On the downside its recoil
        can sometimes prove to be difficult to manage, and its relatively small clip
        size demands frequent reloads.<\/p><ul><li>Parts Slots: 4<\/li><li>Default
        Ammo Count: 40<\/li><\/ul><h3>Machine Pistol-AF<\/h3><p>A somewhat secret
        submachine gun also exclusive to Claire, the MP-AF can only be attained by
        solving the grave puzzle nearing the end of episode 3. Its overall damage
        output and accuracy is superior to the MP-AB50, as is its clip size, although
        its rate of fire is slightly slower.<\/p><ul><li>Parts Slots: 3<\/li><\/ul><h3>Shotgun
        M147S<\/h3><p>A classic hunting shotgun Claire soon acquires in episode 1.
        The M147S is reliable enough for its raw power and high chance of knocking
        an enemy to the ground, however its small capacity of only 2 slots per reload
        is a noticeable drawback.<\/p><ul><li>Parts Slots: 3<\/li><li>Default Ammo
        Count: 2<\/li><\/ul><h3>Shotgun TAP194<\/h3><p>A more modern alternative to
        the M147S. The TAP194 isn''t as powerful, nor can it hold as many parts, though
        its larger round capacity of five can still prove to give it an edge. The
        TAP194 can be acquired by both Claire and Barry; for Claire it''s easily accessible
        to collect in plain view during episode 2, though for Barry it requires a
        specific combination of lever pulls for the crane in episode 5, requiring
        more effort on the part of the player to acquire.<\/p><ul><li>Parts Slots:
        2<\/li><li>Default Ammo Count: 5<\/li><\/ul><h3>Assault Rifle NSR47<\/h3><p>A
        reliable assault rifle that Barry brings with him on his mission. The NSR47
        has a decent rate of fire and damage output, making it suitable for all occasions.<\/p><ul><li>Part
        Slots: 3<\/li><li>Default Ammo Count: 30<\/li><\/ul><h3>Assault Rifle AK-7<\/h3><p>A
        secret assault rifle alternative for Barry. The AK-7 can only be acquired
        should Claire open up the necessary gate that''ll eventually allow Barry access
        to it. The AK-7''s primary strength is its much larger clip capacity in relation
        to the NSR47 and has more part slots. Its damage output is slightly smaller,
        however.<\/p><ul><li>Part Slots: 4<\/li><li>Default Ammo Count: 60<\/li><\/ul><h3>Magnum
        Model 329<\/h3><p>A magnum revolver exclusive to Claire. In relation to the
        other magnums of the game the Model 329 fits in the middle as a jack of all
        trades.<\/p><ul><li>Part Slots: 2<\/li><li>Default Ammo Count: 6<\/li><\/ul><h3>Magnum
        Python<\/h3><p>Barry''s personal favorite magnum revolver of choice, dating
        all the way back since the <a href=\"\/resident-evil\/3030-5842\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5842\">Mansion
        Incident <\/a>of 1998. The Python is the weakest magnum in the game, though
        it has the most available part slots.<\/p><ul><li>Part Slots: 3<\/li><li>Default
        Ammo Count: 6<\/li><\/ul><h3>Magnum 2005M<\/h3><p>The most powerful magnum
        in the game which Barry alone can eventually acquire. Alongside being the
        most powerful it has the fastest rate of fire, while also still sharing the
        same overall chamber capacity as the other magnums. Its one main drawback
        is that it has the smallest set of part slots, leaving little space for potential
        upgrades.<\/p><ul><li>Part Slots: 1<\/li><li>Default Ammo Count: 6<\/li><\/ul><h3>Rifle
        M1891\/30<\/h3><p>A powerful bolt-action rifle. Its low rate of fire isn''t
        ideal, nor is its default capacity, though its damage output still makes for
        a formidable weapon.<\/p><ul><li>Part Slots: 3<\/li><li>Default Ammo Count:
        5<\/li><\/ul><h3>Rifle SVD<\/h3><p>A more modern Russian-made counterpart.
        The SVD is semi-auto and can hold more rounds, making it the more accessible
        of the two available sniper rifles, although its power isn''t as great and
        it can''t equip as many parts.<\/p><ul><li>Part Slots: 2<\/li><li>Default
        Ammo Count: 10<\/li><\/ul><h3>Explosive Bottle<\/h3><p>The game''s equivalent
        of a grenade, explosive bottles will deal a significant amount of damage while
        having a high chance to topple over even the larger enemies of the game.<\/p><h3>Firebomb
        Bottle<\/h3><p>Firebomb bottles won''t do nearly as much base damage as an
        explosive bottle, but will instead deal continuous damage over time. They
        are especially effective against Uroborus monsters.<\/p><h3>Decoy Bottle<\/h3><p>Decoy
        Bottles are much weaker than both explosive and firebomb bottles, however
        they make up for it by being able to lure enemies away. Whence thrown, all
        nearby enemies will follow the bottle and attempt to attack it. If they hit
        the bottle it will explode dealing minor damage and having a high chance in
        knocking the enemies onto the ground. It will otherwise explode on its own
        after ten seconds have passed since it was thrown regardless of whether any
        enemies are nearby or not.<\/p><h3>Smokescreen Bottle<\/h3><p>Smokescreen
        bottles deal no damage whatsoever, but will instead make the player temporarily
        invisible to any enemies caught within the smoke. This also allows players
        to commit a stealth-kill from behind whilst the enemies are oblivious to the
        player amidst the smoke.<\/p><h2>Enemies<\/h2><h3>Afflicted<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\"

        such a degree that they have gone irreparably insane and will attack people
        on sight.<\/p><p>The Afflicted are incredibly aggressive and will typically
        sprint towards the player and attempt to overwhelm them, as will they attempt
        to skirt around a player''s reticle\/laser sight when aimed at. They''re often
        seen to be equipped with crude weapons such as clubs or other such melee weapons,
        though will otherwise use their hands to attack and\/or to grab &amp; bite
        the player if close enough, requiring players to wiggle the analogue stick
        to escape their grasp. They will also often leap through the air in their
        attempt to attack the player as well. Shots to the head have a high chance
        of stunning an Afflicted, allowing players to then perform a melee attack.
        Shooting them in the legs as they''re running also has a high chance in tripping
        them to the ground.<\/p><p>Some Afflicted will be shown to have a bulbous
        substance growing on their head. If the substance is shot, the Afflicted will
        die immediately, however the substance will now have spread to the floor as
        small puddles. If the puddles are shot, or if the player gets too close, they
        will rapidly begin to expand and explode. The damage done is severe and will
        temporarily fill the screen with a sort of green mucus. Moira''s flashlight
        can be used to melt the puddles, however.<\/p><p>For as dangerous as they
        are, they can also be used as a trap if they''re shot while other enemies
        are nearby; they will not explode on their own should an enemy simply walk
        past one.<\/p><h3>Sploder<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\"

        whence an Afflicted has taken enough damage, it will begin to become embroiled
        by the aforementioned bubbly substance until it is completely overwhelmed
        by it. While much slower, a Sploder (as the name suggests) will explode should
        it get close enough to the player, however a backwards dodge maneuver should
        give the player enough space to escape the blast radius. If players are hit
        by the explosion, the damage dealt is severe and the screen will be covered
        in mucus.<\/p><p>Players can choose to deal damage to make it explode prematurely,
        however its defense is surprisingly sturdier than that of a regular Afflicted
        and may prove to be a waste of ammo.<\/p><h3>Ironhead<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\"

        strongest common enemy type encountered in Claire''s segments. Ironheads somewhat
        resemble the Executioner from Resident Evil 5, in that they tend to slowly
        advance towards the player and their large axe attacks cover a wide berth.
        However Ironheads can prove to be surprisingly nimble and will sometimes rush
        towards the player swinging their axe. Attacks from an Ironhead will not only
        commit a fair amount of damage, but also have a very high chance in making
        the character bleed as well. Ironheads are also rather resistant to damage
        and can even withstand a fair degree of knockback from a shotgun. An explosive
        bottle will nearly always topple one over, however they often tend to get
        back to their feet almost immediately.<\/p><p>Because of the helmet they wear
        shots to the head are completely ineffective. Though there''s a chance they''ll
        become stunned should they get shot in the red patch of skin surrounding their
        upper torso, allowing players to perform a melee attack.<\/p><h3>Vulcanblubber<\/h3><p>A
        miniboss encountered infrequently during Claire''s segments. Vulcanblubbers
        are large, obese monsters that are equipped with a sort of cannon and torch.
        They will place the torch in the cannon to then launch fireballs at the player;
        the frequency of the fireballs differ, as they will sometimes shoot only one,
        while at other times will shoot four. Vulcanblubbers also have the capability
        to arch their shots overhead like a mortar. Should a fireball hit the player
        they will be temporarily engulfed in flames, which slowly deals damage; the
        base damage of the attack is also rather moderate to begin with. Besides their
        cannon, vulcanblubbers will sometimes rush towards the player in an attempt
        to perform a melee attack.<\/p><p>Vulcanblubbers are one of the most durable
        enemies in the game and have no discernible weak points, often requiring a
        significant amount of ammunition to kill.<\/p><h3>Giant Whip Spider<\/h3><p>Large
        hostile insects, though they rarely ever function as much of a threat. The
        damage they inflict isn''t alarming and they can be killed with a single knife
        swipe. These are encountered across both Claire &amp; Barry''s segments.<\/p><h3>Rotten<\/h3><figure

        common enemy type featured in Barry''s portion. The Rotten are in fact the
        Afflicted, only the passage of time has left them weak and decayed. They are
        thusly much slower compared to an Afflicted, though they will still attempt
        to attack by way of biting or slapping the player if they can get close enough.
        Rotten will often fall to the floor, if they''re not already on the floor,
        and will instead slowly slither towards the player and attack from this position.<\/p><p>Rotten
        are also much less resistant to gunfire and can be dispatched much more easily,
        making them a significantly less threatening foe than the Afflicted.<\/p><p>
        <\/p><h3> <\/h3><h3>Othrus<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\"

        Othrus are horrific canine-like creatures that will rapidly run and leap at
        the player. Their speed and tenacity can make them difficult to shoot, however
        they''re not very strong and will die after only a few handgun shots. Each
        shot will also topple an Othrus over, potentially allowing players to easily
        keep one stunlocked should it be on its own.<\/p><p>Othrus are commonly encountered
        in both Claire and Barry''s segments.<\/p><h3>Revenant<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\"

        src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/10354\/2705572-nope.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>One
        of the primary opponents during Barry''s segments. The Revenants are wretched
        creatures that are linked to the Uroborus virus that was created by Albert
        Wesker and unleashed during Resident Evil 5.<\/p><p>Despite their decrepit
        appearance, Revenants can withstand a significant amount of damage. The only
        way one will permanently die is if its bright orange weak spot is destroyed.
        The easiest way to locate it is by controlling Natalia and having her use
        her special sight to pinpoint its location. Though players can still simply
        shoot at it until they inevitably reveal its weak spot. Like all other enemies,
        Revenants are susceptible to stealth kills; regardless of where their weak
        point is located, a stealth kill will still kill them outright.<\/p><p>Revenants
        are initially slow in movement, but as a countermeasure will sometimes scurry
        around on all fours to rush the player. They will attack with whatever makeshift
        weapons they have attached to their person, though they will also attempt
        to violently grab and squeeze the player if they get close enough. Some Revenants
        will be shown to have a bloated arm or leg, which they will use to spray an
        acidic substance at the player, covering the screen with mucus.<\/p><h3>Glasp<\/h3><figure
        data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10354\/2737003-grasp_render.png\"

        src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/10354\/2737003-grasp_render.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>A
        bug-like sort of creature that is completely invisible to the human eye. Glasps
        only have one attack, which functions as an instant-kill, however they need
        to be right up close to the player to enact it. Glasps are primarily encountered
        in Barry''s portion, and while Barry himself cannot see them Natalia can use
        her special vision to keep track of their location. When playing as Barry
        in single-player, Natalia will keep her finger pointed at the Glasp and will
        call out directions to help Barry nail the shot. To counter their invisibility
        and instant-kill attack, Glasps are rather fragile and can be killed with
        about three handgun shots. However every shot will often knock the Glasp aside
        slightly, requiring players to try and relocate its position per shot. Besides
        Natalia''s vision, players can also throw smokescreen bottles to temporarily
        bring the glasp into full view.<\/p><p>While glasps may be invisible to all
        characters besides Natalia, whenever any character comes close enough the
        screen will begin to exhibit a filter of what resemble heat waves, which intensifies
        the closer the player gets to the glasp. Glasps also have a distinct tell
        by way of their buzzing wings to further note their vicinity.<\/p><h3>Slinger<\/h3><p>Another
        Uroborus-infused enemy like the Revenant encountered in Barry''s segments.
        Slingers function as long-ranged catapults that will routinely sling their
        right arm at the player, which will explode on impact. The damage dealt from
        the attack is severe and will also cover the screen in mucus. However the
        windup to the attack is relatively lengthy, as is the time it takes for a
        Slinger to produce another of its projectiles. All damage against the Slinger
        is effective, though its weak point is the glowing orange bulb in the middle;
        Slingers can also only ultimately be killed by a shot to the orange orb.<\/p><h3>Dhurlga<\/h3><p>Another
        Uroborus enemy, also only encountered in Barry''s segments. Dhurlgas are one
        of the toughest and most antagonizing enemies in the game. Like other Uroborus
        enemies the dhurlga''s weak point is the glowing orange area, which for the
        dhurgla encompasses practically all of its middle-section. However it is protected
        by a number of tendrils and a long pincer. The tendrils can be destroyed--fire
        bottles are especially effective--however the pincer is invulnerable and will
        still provide protection for most of its front. As such, attacks against dhurlga
        are best handled from the side or rear, though explosive bottles can also
        be used to topple one over, allowing players easy access to its weak point.
        However it will only topple over if the bottle is thrown so the explosion
        occurs behind it, as the pincer can even protect against explosions.<\/p><p>The
        dhurglas offensive capabilities are high, as its pincer has a wide reach of
        attack and can do a hefty amount of damage. Furthermore, it has an instant-kill
        attack where it will charge towards the player in the hopes of catching them
        with its pincer. Though before charging it well let out a distinctive shriek
        to note the preparation of the attack.<\/p><h2>Boss Battles<\/h2><h3>Mutant
        Pedro<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10354\/2738115-mutant_pedro_concept.png\"

        src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/10354\/2738115-mutant_pedro_concept.jpg\"\/><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>Due
        to the effects of the T-Phobos virus, the fear Pedro experiences triggers
        a transformation into a hulking monster. The drill he was using to help enter
        houses blockaded by concrete has now become his weapon at that, with Pedro
        functioning somewhat akin to the chainsaw-wielding enemies of Resident Evil
        games past.<\/p><p>Pedro is potentially fought twice during the game, once
        as Claire and again as Barry. However as Claire he is much more difficult
        the first time through due to the player''s lack of sufficient weaponry. Should
        players kill Pedro as Claire then he will not be fought as Barry.<\/p><p>Pedro
        attacks exclusively with his drill, which he will routinely swing wildly.
        His other most prominent attack is where he charges towards the player with
        the drill; if it hits it is an instant-kill, though even his regular attacks
        will deal a significant amount of damage. If the player dodges his charge,
        there''s a chance Pedro may rush right into the wall, leaving his drill temporarily
        stuck and making Pedro vulnerable to attack. Simply shooting Pedro will eventually
        do the trick, however there are number of eyes plastered all over Pedro that
        serve as his weak points and will bring the battle to a quicker conclusion.<\/p><h3>Neil
        Fisher<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10354\/2738114-2015-03-11_00031.jpg\"

        being injected with the Uroborus virus, Neil transforms into a huge, bulky
        monster with the requisite tentacles at his disposal. Neil will usually walk
        towards the player, but will also tend to break into a sprint with the intent
        of knocking the player to the ground; despite his size he also proves his
        agility by occasionally leaping to the walkways above. His most formidable
        means of attack is with his tentacles, which he will use in a whip-like fashion.
        He will at first only use them for close-quarters to slash at the player,
        though at a certain point he will begin to shoot his tentacles forward like
        a spear of sorts, giving him a much greater range of attack.<\/p><p>Much like
        against the Uroborus-induced transformation of Excella Gionne, Neil will routinely
        spawn numerous little Uroborus pods. The pods themselves cannot move, but
        will deal damage if the player steps too close. They can be killed easily
        enough and will eventually die of their own accord after a certain amount
        of time, often dropping supplies for the player to collect in the process.<\/p><p>Like
        all Uroborus creatures Neil''s innate weakness is that of fire. Fire bottles
        will thusly work well against him, and there also happens to be a number of
        large crates containing missiles. Should Neil accidentally attack one, or
        charge into one, they will explode dealing a significant amount of fire damage.
        Moira''s flashlight can also be used to deal fire damage, too. After Neil
        undergoes so much fire damage, his entire body will begin to redden and his
        glowy-orange heart will expose itself, giving players the chance to deal severe
        damage to Neil. Shortly after it''s become exposed Neil will run away and
        smash open one of the water pipes to help himself cool off, allowing his heart
        to succumb back behind its mass of Uroborus tentacles. Players can repeat
        this process as many times as possible, though the explosive canisters are
        finite and it may prove to be difficult to trigger his heart exposure with
        Moira''s flashlight alone. All damage dealt to Neil is effective, though of
        course his heart is where it counts the most.<\/p><h3>Alex Wesker Part I<\/h3><p>Alex
        is first fought by Barry in her lab. After suffering the self-inflicted effects
        of both the T-Phobos and Uroborus viruses, Alex is now an animalistic creature
        with an incredibly long and exposed spine. She will primarily move on all
        fours and use her hands to swipe in front of her; it has a fair amount of
        range and will knock the player over should it hit, alongside doing a moderate
        amount of damage. Sometimes Alex will stand on her two legs with her arms
        raised up and will then slam down towards the ground, which is her most powerful
        attack.<\/p><p>Throughout the fight she will scurry into the vents, maneuver
        around inside, and then pop out from one and spit a gob of fluid that will
        explode in a large cloud of gas. The gas will slowly choke the player the
        longer they reside within it, though it won''t actually do any damage. While
        it will kill the player eventually, once they escape the gas the effects will
        wear off immediately. When inside the vents Natalia can use her vision to
        detect which one she plans to pop out of.<\/p><p>Like all Uroborus creatures
        Alex has a glowy-orange weak point, representing her heart much like Neil.
        It''s at first hidden away, though Alex suffers enough damage will expose
        itself. Whenever Alex pops out of the vents it will be exposed as well. When
        a certain amount of continuous damage has been dealt, Alex will be shown to
        be in a dazed state, and from there a shot to her heart will flip her over
        onto her back leaving her extremely vulnerable for a time.<\/p><h3>Alex Wesker
        Part II<\/h3><p>The final battle of the game. This boss is only fought should
        players have switched to Moira in Episode 3 to finish off Neil after he knocks
        Claire to the ground, otherwise the game will end after the first Wesker battle.<\/p><p>Alex
        Wesker retains all of the same attacks she had in the first fight, though
        the design is somewhat different. In single player players will switch control
        between Barry and Claire. Barry will be on the ground level, while Claire
        provides sniper support from a helicopter. Players will start off as Claire
        and must safeguard Barry as runs away from Alex. Claire is equipped with the
        SVD sniper rifle and has infinite ammo. When Barry enters one of the caves
        the player will then take control of Barry; should he exit the cave, players
        regain control of Claire. The battle plays out like this until Alex has taken
        enough damage to trigger Barry telling Claire to use the RPG launcher. From
        there the player will then have access to the RPG and must use it to kill
        Wesker.<\/p><h2>Unlockables<\/h2><p>As with most Resident Evil games, Revelations
        2 includes many unlockable bonuses for players to strive for, including weapons,
        costumes, and modes.<\/p><h3>No Escape Difficulty<\/h3><p>This difficulty
        is unlocked upon completing the game on its Survival difficulty setting.<\/p><h3>Countdown
        Mode<\/h3><p>Countdown Mode has players play through the main campaign, only
        now with a timer ticking down. To increase their time they must kill enemies,
        and can also boost their time by destroying time bonuses that are located
        throughout the level. Each episode has its own separate Countdown Mode, requiring
        players to purchase (with BP) each one individually.<\/p><p>The player''s
        inventory is predetermined per episode, though their Skills upgrades will
        still carry over.<\/p><h3>Invisible Enemy Mode<\/h3><p>Making its return from
        the <a href=\"\/resident-evil\/3030-27715\" data-ref-id=\"3030-27715\">Resident
        Evil remake<\/a> (which was coincidentally remastered within the same year),
        Invisible Enemy Mode will naturally make all enemies (including bosses) invisible
        to the player. However players can use Moira''s flashlight, and Natalia''s
        vision during Barry''s segments, to get a glimpse of where the enemies are.<\/p><p>Like
        with Countdown Mode, each episode has its own Invisible Enemy Mode that must
        be purchased individually; the player''s inventory is also once again predetermined,
        though Skills will continue to persist. The damage modifiers are set within
        the Survival difficulty setting.<\/p><h3>Costumes<\/h3><p>Both Claire and
        Barry have costumes available for purchase. Claire has two: first is her classic
        Resident Evil 2 attire, and second is her Sniper outfit that she wears during
        the final battle against Alex Wesker. Barry only has one, being his classic
        S.T.A.R.S. outfit.<\/p><h3>Weapons<\/h3><h4>Crossbow<\/h4><p>Ada''s Wong crossbow
        from Resident Evil 6. It can only shoot a single bolt at a time, and doesn''t
        do an exceptional amount of damage, but it has infinite ammo. Due to being
        an ''EX'' weapon, equipping it will automatically restrict the player to attaining
        a C rank at the highest, and all BP collected is cut in half during the episode.<\/p><h4>Chicago
        Typewriter<\/h4><p>The classic mafia-inspired submachine gun first introduced
        in Resident Evil 4. Though since then the weapon functions very differently
        over its original appearance. For starters it no longer has infinite ammo,
        though also thusly doesn''t inflict any punishments for using it like the
        crossbow, and is now fired from the hip as opposed to over the shoulder. While
        it no longer carries infinite cash of ammunition, it is still able to store
        a significant amount in its barrel, while having a very fast rate of fire
        and also being extremely powerful to boot, beating out both assault rifles
        in sheer damage output.<\/p><h4>Meat Grinder<\/h4><p>A powerful drill that
        will rip through everything in its path; despite being a melee weapon it still
        must be placed in one of the four weapon slots for use. It can be used indefinitely
        without any sort of reloading function, though due to being an EX weapon it
        will restrict the player to getting no higher than a C rank for the Episode
        and a decrease in BP accumulation.<\/p><h4>RPG Launcher<\/h4><p>An RPG that
        can kill virtually everything with a single shot and comes with infinite ammo.<\/p><h3>Screen
        Effects<\/h3><p>These provide a filter that changes the look of the game:<\/p><p><strong>Classic
        Horror<\/strong> - Makes the game black &amp; white.<\/p><h3>Concept Art,
        Figurines and Secret Files<\/h3><p>Concept art depicts many of the characters
        and enemy designs during their conception phase; Figurines allow players to
        maneuver around an inanimate rendering of the character and enemy models from
        the game; and Secret Files provide some additional insight into the characters
        and the events across the series.<\/p><h2>Raid Mode<\/h2><p>Raid mode functions
        very similarly to how it was in the first Revelations. Players can select
        from a number of characters and outfits, each of which have their own specialities,
        and must then fight through different stages to level up and attain randomised
        loot such as weapons and weapon modification parts. While cooperative play
        is restricted to local-only for the story, Raid mode allows players to play
        cooperative both locally and online for up to two players, however online
        play was only made accessible from April 1st, 2015.<\/p><p>For preordering
        the game''s ''Complete Season'' edition, or by buying the physical version,
        players gain access to the ''Throwback Pack'', which includes a new set of
        Gauntlets set on four maps not otherwise featured in the mode.<\/p><h2>Downloadable
        Content<\/h2><h3>Costumes<\/h3><p>Each of the main cast has available a costume
        for purchase. Claire''s is of her wearing a cowgirl outfit in short-shorts;
        Moira''s dresses her up as a scantily clad ''urban ninja''; Barry''s is that
        of him dressed up as a ship commandant; and Natalia''s has her cosplay as
        her stuffed teddy bear, <a href=\"\/lottie\/3005-31993\" data-ref-id=\"3005-31993\">Lottie<\/a>.
        The costumes can be purchased together in a pack or purchased separately.
        All of the costumes come packaged in with the retail release.<\/p><h2>Bonus

        Struggle is an additional story episode set during the six-month period between
        the end of Claire''s segments and the beginning of Barry''s. It follows Moira
        Burton and Evgeny Rebic amidst their survival on the island. The episode takes
        place across environments taken from the main episodes - specifically Barry''s
        segments.<\/p><p>Both bonus episodes are apart of the Complete Season and
        physical retail releases, though they can also be purchased separately like
        any other episode of the game. Unlike the main episodes, the only difficulty
        settings available are Casual and Survival. Furthermore, the episode must
        be completed in one sitting as there is no save functionality, though the
        episode is shorter than the main story episodes. The weapon selection is pre-determined,
        though players can procure more weapons throughout the episode. There are
        no unlockable weapons nor NG+ features for The Struggle, though the player''s
        Skills will persist for the episode.<\/p><p>Owning The Struggle adds a new
        costume for Moira for use in both the main story and as an unlockable in Raid
        Mode. Evgeny is also available as an unlockable Raid Mode character courtesy
        of the episode.<\/p><h3>Story<\/h3><p>After being saved by a Russian local--Evgeny,
        though Moira doesn''t yet know his name nor does Evgeny wish to know hers--of
        the island that they had briefly met prior, Moira is allowed to share his
        shelter so long as she assists him in hunting; Moira, now resigned to using
        firearms, agrees to the deal. Though during her attempts to search for an
        escape off the island, she inadvertently leads a group of Afflicted to their
        hideout. Though they manage to defend themselves, the Russian scolds Moira
        for her recklessness and states that she will never go home and that it''s
        useless to try. Moira reluctantly agrees and accepts her predicament.<\/p><p>However
        as time goes on, Uroborus enemies such as Revenants begin appearing and are
        killing all of the animals. The two also discover a file listing a number
        of people sent for experimentation, one of which being the man''s daughter,
        Irina. Moira thusly decides that they should locate Irina, despite strongly
        believing her to be deceased, to help give the man some closure. After fighting
        their way through an onslaught of Uroborus, they discover that Irina is indeed
        dead.<\/p><p>Despite their initially antagonistic relationship, Moira and
        the man grew to respect one another as time went on. So when the man decides
        to lock himself in his room and await death, Moira pleads on the other side
        of the door with tears in her eyes for him to come out. However the man had
        been slowly dying from an illness, and in the midst of Moira''s pleas dies,
        but only before they each finally exchange their names. Not wanting her own
        dad Barry to suffer through the same grief Evgeny suffered, Moira is filled
        with an even greater determination to survive. Upon exploring the island some
        more, she locates Barry''s BSAA badge and is able to arrive just in time to
        stop the monstrous Alex Wesker from killing Natalia Korda.<\/p><h3>Playable
        Characters<\/h3><p>Unlike the main episodes, the cooperative duo is now made
        up of two characters who both have access to firearms, though Evgeny can only
        use his bolt-action sniper rifle. Moira can equip up to four weapons just
        like Claire\/Barry, though she still has access to her flashlight which now
        takes up a weapon slot; it can also be traded for a different weapon should
        the player choose. Moira still uses her crowbar as opposed to a combat knife,
        though she now otherwise plays exactly like Claire. Evgeny has a combat knife
        for his melee weapon, and as he''s the secondary character he is allowed to
        be downed without the game ending and can be revived; should Moira perish,
        however, then it''s game over. Evgeny will fire his weapon even when operating
        independently, though even with the ''Unholstered'' Skill purchased Evgeny
        will use up ammunition, but each shot will also be of full power.<\/p><h3>Stages<\/h3><p>The
        Struggle is set across four segments. The first has Moira &amp; Evgeny hunting
        wildlife for food, which is recorded up top by way of bag icons. Whence a
        bag is shown to be orange, that means the player has filled one up completely.
        The bags actually function as the player''s lives across the episode, with
        the player able to accumulate 5 bags in total, so whenever the player should
        die (or the time runs out during certain scenarios) they will lose a life;
        should all lives be used up the player must then restart the episode from
        the beginning. During the first segment there is a 15 minute timer ticking
        away to signify the arrival of night time; players are to thusly try to collect
        as many bags and supplies as they can within the time, and are to then reach
        the lumber mill and press the button prompt next to the chained up gate to
        end the segment.<\/p><p>The following scenario somewhat plays out as a series
        of wave-based survival sessions set in the sewers, requiring players to kill
        all the enemies. During each wave the game will transition the player to a
        different part of the environment amidst a quick fade in and out. The next
        segment then has players again attempt to acquire supplies and food, however
        this time players must also try and to stay out of sight from the patrolling
        Revenant enemies. Moira is to be the one on the ground level searching for
        supplies, while Evgeny is perched up top so as to provide a better survey
        of the area. If a Revenant spots the player, the timer will drop to 30 seconds
        requiring players to rush to the exit. If the time runs out it''ll count as
        a loss of life and even if the alerted Revenant is killed the timer will not
        be reimbursed. As such, head-on conflicts with Revenants are to be avoided
        and stealth is of the essence, although they can at least be stealth killed
        without setting an alert.<\/p><p>The final scenario once again involves more
        wave survival, requiring players to kill all the attacking enemies within
        the area as the game takes them from one arena to the next.<\/p><h2>Bonus
        Episode: Little Miss<\/h2><h3>Overview<\/h3><p>The second episode focusses
        on Natalia Korda during the 6-month period from where she was put into hypersleep
        by Alex Wesker at the end of Claire''s segments, and ultimately to when she
        first meets Barry. However unlike the other episodes of the combat Little
        Miss is completely devoid of combat; smokescreen bottles can at least be found,
        though that''s the only useable item in the episode. This episode still also
        stars two characters, only the characters are Natalia Korda and another Natalia
        Korda, one whom is depicted as being the polar opposite to the more recognizable
        Natalia. The episode takes place across environments taken from the main episodes
        - specifically Claire''s segments. However the environments are coated in
        a dream-like aesthetic and filled with a pink fog.<\/p><p>Owning Little Miss
        adds a new costume for Natalia to wear during the main story episodes.<\/p><h3>Story<\/h3><p>Natalia
        awakens from the slumber she was put under by Alex Wesker for six months.
        Although awake, Natalia is shown to travel through a dream-like world and
        is assisted by another, blonde Natalia; one whom is chiding and mean, and
        basically the polar opposite to the other Natalia. The good Natalia wishes
        to try and find her stuffed teddy bear, Lottie, whom has been leaving postcards
        to help her in her journey. With the assistance of the bad Natalia, who has
        the special vision that the good Natalia will inherit, they are able to elude
        the Revenants and Glasps they encounter on their travels. However bad Natalia
        is all the while ridiculing good Natalia for her reliance on her teddy bear
        and that she should instead accept her as her best friend. The good Natalia
        continues her search all the same.<\/p><p>Upon finding Lottie, who despite
        being a stuffed teddy bear is ''alive'' and is shown to talk, Lottie calls
        the good Natalia a bitch and laughs at her before receding back as a regular
        teddy bear. The bad Natalia is then revealed to have been the consciousness
        of Alex Wesker in her attempts to take over the real Natalia''s body. After
        a promise that Alex will keep trying, the real Natalia then finds herself
        back in the real world and notices from afar the boat of Barry Burton making
        its way to the island.<\/p><h3>Playable Characters<\/h3><p>The objective of
        the episode is for the two Natalia''s to get through the environments without
        being seen; upon being seen it will be game over, though unlike The Struggle
        players can continue as much as they like; the episode must still be completed
        in one setting, however. Regular Natalia doesn''t have any of her abilities
        from Barry''s segments; the other Natalia on the other hand does, including
        a new ability to tag a single enemy so they''ll show up even when playing
        as regular Natalia. The other Natalia is also completely invisible to all
        enemies, though she cannot interact with any doors. The other Natalia is to
        thusly act as a lookout to survey the area to then better plan how to get
        the regular Natalia through.<\/p><h2>Development<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\"

        image<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Resident Evil: Revelations 2 was leaked on
        Xbox.com via a game listing complete with a single screenshot and the boxart
        in August of 2014. However it wasn''t until Sony''s pre-TGS conference on
        the 1st of September, 2014 that it was officially announced by <a href=\"\/capcom\/3010-367\"
        data-ref-id=\"3010-367\">Capcom<\/a>, complete with an early 2015 release
        date. No gameplay was shown, although there was a melancholic live-action
        teaser trailer that is said to represent the tone of the full game.<\/p><p>The
        team developing Revelations 2 is to be largely made up of the same people
        involved with the first Revelations game. The episodic release of the game
        was designed so as to foster communication amongst fans about the prior episode''s
        cliffhanger ect. during the wait for the next episode, akin to a TV show.<\/p><p>Rather
        than branding it as Resident Evil 7, Capcom aimed to turn the Revelations
        subtitle into its own smaller scale sub-series. This then allows them to experiment
        with horror themes and tropes akin to the earlier games, while also keeping
        the higher action-focus of the series intact with the franchise''s numbered
        entries.<\/p><p>Claire Redfield has said to have been chosen as the lead for
        Revelations 2 from the very beginning of the game''s conception, however Moira
        was introduced later. Capcom producer Michiteru Okabe has said that the progression
        of the game''s development has caught him by surprise, and that he never predicted
        it would ultimately end up with two female leads in the starring roles --
        a first for the series. While Capcom have begun developing games on their
        new <a href=\"\/panta-rhei-engine\/3015-7802\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7802\">Panta

        image for Claire Redfield was originally shown with her featuring a rather

        the image to make her expression less exaggerated.<\/p><h3>''Concept Teaser''<\/h3><p>The
        debut trailer--dubbed a Concept Teaser--included numerable easter eggs and
        secrets for viewers to discover, some of which were hints as to the game''s
        story along with appearances of main characters Moira Burton, Barry Burton,
        and Natalia Korda.<\/p><p>At the full TGS show, Capcom then released an extended
        version of the aforementioned teaser trailer, which included more easter eggs
        and an additional shot featuring what looks to be Claire Redfield being swarmed
        by zombies.<\/p><p>A list of the easter eggs peppered throughout the trailer
        includes:<\/p><ul><li>\"Itchy Tasty\" reference.<\/li><li><a href=\"\/rachael-foley\/3005-21932\"

        references to the Terragrigia incident from the first Revelations and the
        events in the African town of Kijuju during Resident Evil 5. The people the
        Terra Save members are shown assisting are also the same Majini character

        The Darkside Chronicles is an on-rails shooter for the Wii and a follow-up
        to Resident Evil:  The Umbrella Chronicles. The story of Resident Evil 2,
        Resident Evil Code: Veronica, as well as a prequel to Resident Evil 4, make
        up the games three scenarios.","description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><p>Resident
        Evil: The Darkside Chronicles is a follow-up to the million-selling <a href=\"\/resident-evil-the-umbrella-chronicles\/3030-11454\"
        data-ref-id=\"3030-11454\">Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles<\/a>. The
        game touches upon the main Resident Evil titles not represented in The Umbrella
        Chronicles, namely Resident Evil 2, Resident Evil Code: Veronica, and an entirely
        new story which serves as a prequel to Resident Evil 4. Like its predecessor,
        the game was a Wii exclusive that is now available for download on the Playstation
        Network.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>Notable differences from Umbrella Chronicles
        is the addition of a more intense and \"shaky\" camera to add tension to the
        presentation. Similar to its predecessor, ammo, health (green herbs and first-aid
        spray), and gold can be found during gameplay and carried over from each level.
        Gold found during the level or at the grading screen at the end of each mission
        can be used to upgrade weapon grades. Upgrades include reload speed, stopping
        power, and the strength of each weapon. There is no restriction to when you
        can switch weapons from storage and assign them to the direction pad.<\/p><p>Unlike
        in The Umbrella Chronicles, the player''s partner character will occasionally
        be visible on screen in the single-player mode, both to assist in shooting
        and to be rescued. The second character will always be present, whether or
        not there is a second player controlling him. Occasionally, the game will
        present alternate routes through a level.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><p>A drug lord
        Javier Hidalgo has disappeared after attempting to contact Umbrella. Leon
        S. Kennedy and Jack Krauser have been sent to South America to find him. They
        approach a coastal village with the intention of meeting a contact who will
        guide. Krauser is a bit skeptical about the existence of Bio-Organic Weapons
        (B.O.W.s), but knows that Leon has encountered them in the past. As they enter
        the village, a radio news report talks about the recent disappearance of more
        than fifty teenage girls. Soon afterwards, Krauser gets first hand confirmation
        of their existence, as zombies and other monsters attack.<\/p><p>They find
        the guide alive fatally wounded. He tells them that he helped a girl escape
        from Javier''s mansion, but she brought devils with her. The Leon and Krauser
        make their way to the church where they find the girl, who appears to be wounded
        with a bandage around her arm. She''s singing as a monster listens on. The
        girl passes out, and the monster notices the the two intruders and attacks.
        The two are able to chase the monster away, and Krauser decides that it''s
        time that Leon tells him everything he knows.<\/p><p>Leon then retells the
        story of his first day as a police officer of the Raccoon City Police Department,
        when Raccoon City was overwhelmed by the T-Virus. He met Claire Redfield and
        together they learn the city has been infested by zombies. They make their
        way to the police station for safety, only to find the police station has
        also fallen. There is a survivor, a little girl named Sherry, but she is frighted
        at their appearance, and runs. As they attempt to save the girl and escape
        alive, they discover she is the daughter of two scientists, Annette and William
        Birkin.<\/p><p>In the sewers beneath the city, the run into Annette, and she
        tells them that the creature chasing Sherry is her husband, William. After
        being shot, injected himself with a new virus he and Annette had been working
        on, the G-virus. William manages to catch up to Sherry, and In his transformed
        state, his drive to procreate leads him to infecting his daughter with the
        virus. Leon and Claire manage to reach the cure in an underground Umbrella
        facility and cure Sherry, then kill William Birkin and escape from the city
        alive. Claire sets off to continue her search for her brother, while Leon
        is pressured into working for the US government.<\/p><p>The story returns
        to South America. The girl wakes up and says her name is Manuela. She agrees
        to lead them to Javier. They make their way up a river to a dam controlled
        by the drug lord. The dam is also infested with zombies, and other monsters,
        like the village was. They have to fight their way through because Javier''s
        mansion is on the other side.<\/p><p>Within the dam, Manuela is attacked by
        a zombie and runs off scared. When Leon and Krauser catch up with her, they
        find her singing again. She explains that when she used to be scared, her
        mother used to sing her that song.<\/p><p>Javier tells Manuela to come home
        to him over the speaker system. Manuela runs to the next room yelling out
        \"Father!\". Javier, himself, is standing in the next room, and tells her
        that she has to be patient. She only needs to accept his directions for fifteen
        years to prevent the transformation, and that the man who gave him the Veronica
        virus said it would work. Some of Javier''s men grab Manuela from behind as
        a flood of water comes flooding into the room. Manuela breaks free and jumps
        after Leon and Krauser as they get swept away.<\/p><p>As they wash away, Leon''s
        thoughts revert back to what he knows of the events told to him by Claire
        about the Veronica virus. Claire had been searching for her brother, Chris
        Redfield, in the Umbrella Paris facility when she got caputured and taken
        to an Umbrella training and prison facility on Rockford Island. She meets
        another prisoner, Steve Burnside, and together they try to find a way off
        the island.<\/p><p>They run into the commander of the island, Alfred Ashford,
        who couldn''t get past the absence of his sister, Alexia. He began dressing
        as his sister and having conversations with himself. Claire and Steve secure
        a key to a plane from Alfred, however, once they are in the air, the discover
        that they are not in control and Alfred directs the plane to an Umbrella facility
        in Antarctica.<\/p><p>Alfred attempts to kill Claire and Steve again, and
        once again he fails. However as Claire and Steve make their escape, Alfred
        awakens his sister, who had been in hibernation for fifteen years after injecting
        herself with the Veronica virus. Alexia attacks and the two are captured.<\/p><p>Meanwhile,
        Leon had used his government resources to track down both Chris and Claire
        Redfield. He contacts Chris and tells him about the danger his sister is in.
        He made his way to Antarctica and finds Claire. Alexia tells them that her
        experiment awaits them in the coliseum.<\/p><p>When they reach the colisuem,
        they find Steve after having been injected with the Veronica virus. Without
        the hibernation process that Alexia went through, his mutates before their
        eyes and attacks them. Claire and Chris nearly succeed in defeating him, then
        Alexia moves in to kill them. Steve gains control of himself and frees Claire,
        and then Alexia finishes him off.<\/p><p>Chris and Claire then have a final
        confrontation with Alexia. After they defeat her, they return to the coliseum
        to find Steve''s body gone. A message carved into the wall let''s them know
        that Chris'' ex-team leader, Albert Wesker, is responsible, and now has a
        sample of the Veronica virus in his hands.<\/p><p>The story returns to South
        America once again. Leon and Krauser reunite with Manuela. Leon eventually
        questions her about what''s going on and she unwraps the bandage around her
        arm revealing a diseased arm underneath. Her mother had the same fatal disease,
        that only affects people in the area, and her mother did not survive. She
        says she was injected by the Veronica virus as a as part of her treatment.<\/p><p>Before
        they get to Javier''s mansion, Krauser suggests they should just take care
        of the girl before she becomes a problem. Leon counters that he has to learn
        how Javier is keeping the virus at bay, and shows Krauser that he has special
        orders from the president to eradicate the virus once and for all. Krauser
        agrees, while internally he realizes he is more of a pawn than a player.<\/p><p>Inside
        the mansion, they find a room of human organs, and refrigerator of human bodies.
        All the reported missing girls. Javier appears and tells them that Manuela''s
        organs had to be regularly transplanted to keep away her pain and keep the
        virus at bay. Javier then commands the monster from the church to attack.,
        which Krauser welcomes because he wants to prove how valuable he can be to
        his government.<\/p><p>While fighting the monster, Maneula''s singing distracts
        the monster. As they defeat it, Krauser is badly wounded with one of its spines.
        He says he''s fine, while thinking that it is now the end of his military
        career. As the monster dies, Manuela realizes it was actually her mother.<\/p><p>The
        scene shifts to Javier, and he allows himself to be swallowed by a giant plant
        in his greenhouse. He merges with the plant and attacks Leon and Krauser.
        They try to escape with Manuela, but eventually decide they have to make a
        stand.<\/p><p>While confronting Javier, Manuela decides to accept her pain
        as a sign that she''s still human, and decides it would be better to die rather
        than transform into a monster and so she runs towards her father. Leon rushes
        in to stop her, and tackles her to the ground. Javier raises one of his limbs
        to crush them, and this time Manuela is the one that pushes Leon out of the
        way. She raises her diseased arm and it bursts into flame, stopping Javier.
        They get to their feet, and Manuela continues to fling some of her combustible
        blood at her father as Leon and Krauser finish him off.<\/p><p>They three
        of them fly off in a helicopter. Manuela says she should have died with her
        father. Leon counters that no one should have died, and that she has an obligation
        to live for the sake of the girls inside of her. Manuela is taken into custody
        by the US government.<\/p><p>Meanwhile, Krauser is forced to leave the army.
        He is amazed at the power that Manuela had, and wonders who exactly Wesker
        is, and if he would be able to help him regain his strength.<\/p>","expected_release_day":null,"expected_release_month":null,"expected_release_quarter":null,"expected_release_year":null,"id":25558,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/8\/87790\/1790024-box_retdc.png","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/87790\/1790024-box_retdc.png","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/8\/87790\/1790024-box_retdc.png","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/87790\/1790024-box_retdc.png","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/8\/87790\/1790024-box_retdc.png","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/8\/87790\/1790024-box_retdc.png","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/8\/87790\/1790024-box_retdc.png"},"name":"Resident

        at the hands of Nemesis<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Resident Evil 3 largely
        plays much like its predecessors Resident Evil and Resident Evil 2, and is
        split between a mixture of combating B.O.W.s, exploration and puzzles. Fitted
        with the notorious ''<a href=\"\/tank-controls\/3015-4647\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4647\">tank
        controls<\/a>'' the series became known for, players move via a third person
        perspective throughout a number of pre-determined camera angles.<\/p><p>Players
        are also forced to stay stuck on the spot when attempting to use their weapons,
        though auto-aim is turned on by default, so the character will at least aim
        automatically at whichever enemy is closest -- even if it''s located outside
        of the player''s own perspective. Climbing up\/down stairs is now performed
        manually, allowing the player and even zombies to walk up\/down staircases
        at their own pace. Furthermore, Resident Evil 3 is the first to include the
        180 degree turn, which allows the player character to instantaneously turn
        around by simultaneously pressing down and the ''run'' button.<\/p><p>Another
        new mechanic is that of a dodge maneuver. By hitting the R1 or R2 buttons
        (Default PS1 controls), or by holding the R1 or R2 button then hitting the
        X button right before an attack, Jill will dodge out of the way. If the character
        is equipped with a pistol and should also escape via a roll, Jill will go
        onto one knee which''ll give her a temporary boost to her fire-rate with her
        handgun. However whichever dodge animation the character would use is random.<\/p><p>There
        exists some destructible objects throughout the game which can help the player
        in fending off enemies. Such examples include explosive barrels or a loose
        crane box.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10354\/2781477-re3.jpg\"

        story is largely portrayed via cutscenes, both in-game and CG, however there
        are also a number of Files (diaries, memos ect.) players can collect. These
        will often provide additional insight into the goings on across the overall
        narrative, but some are more vital as they will provide information pertaining
        to solving puzzles or maybe hinting as to where to go next.<\/p><p>Encountering
        differing enemies across multiple playthroughs was introduced in Resident
        Evil 3 to add a sense of unpredictability. Where a player may have faced a
        pack of zombie hounds in a particular area, during another playthrough may
        then find a group of Beta Hunters there instead. A select few encounters with
        Nemesis are randomized as well.<\/p><h3>Playable Characters<\/h3><p>Resident
        Evil 3 only stars one selectable character, being Jill Valentine. Though there
        will also be a short portion of the story where players will temporarily take
        control of UBCS soldier, Carlos Oliveira. Carlos functions exactly like Jill,
        though he does have at least one unique weapon that Jill cannot collect --
        two if playing on Hard mode, being his SIGPRO handgun and M4A1 assault rifle.<\/p><p>On
        one specific occasion when fighting Nemesis in either a restaurant or News
        Office, Carlos may provide assistance as a friendly NPC. He will use his M4A1
        assault rifle, but only on its Manual mode setting, giving it a three-shot
        burst fire. Carlos can also die during this fight, which will result in a
        game over, however he is significantly more durable than the player during
        this fight.<\/p><p>While not playable from a story context, fellow UBCS soldiers
        Mikhail Victor and Nicholai Ginovaef are playable in the unlockable Mercenaries:
        Operation Mad Jackal minigame, as detailed further below.<\/p><h3>Difficulty<\/h3><p>Like
        Resident Evil 2, Resident Evil 3 offers up two distinct difficulty settings,
        ''Easy'' and ''Hard'', with no in-between. The differences are significantly
        more drastic than between the ''Rookie'' and ''Normal'' modes in RE2, however.
        In Easy mode, players start off with an M4A1 Assault Rifle (which is otherwise
        inaccessible besides as an unlockable in Hard mode), and located within the
        first inventory box players find in the Warehouse save room is a hefty selection
        of the game''s weaponry, with a large portion of spare ammunition to go along
        with them. The player''s default inventory is also increased from the eight
        slots in Hard mode to ten (eventually maximising at twelve during the story),
        which functions across both the main game and the unlockable Mercenaries minigame.<\/p><p>When
        playing on Easy Mode, however, players cannot acquire the Nemesis briefcase
        awards for beating him, and the Mine Thrower weapon is removed entirely.<\/p><h3>Inventory<\/h3><figure

        screen, with the character''s health up top.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>All
        characters across the game feature the same inventory space of either eight
        slots or ten, depending on the difficulty as mentioned above. Besides the
        character''s inventory, there also exist a number of <a href=\"\/item-box\/3055-6126\"
        data-ref-id=\"3055-6126\">item boxes<\/a> where players can store unwanted
        items. Item boxes are often located within save rooms (though not always)
        and items will persist throughout all item boxes across the game.<\/p><p>When
        switching between playing as Jill and Carlos in the story, the item boxes
        will not carry over any items.<\/p><h3>Health<\/h3><p>A character''s health
        can be seen via the inventory menu, with an Electrocardiograph Machine showing
        a character''s status. The different statuses are:<\/p><ul><li><strong>Fine
        (green)<\/strong> - The character is in good health.<\/li><li><strong>Caution
        (yellow)<\/strong> - The character is roughly at half health.<\/li><li><strong>Caution
        (orange)<\/strong> - The character is roughly at a quarter of health.<\/li><li><strong>Danger
        (red)<\/strong> - The character is approaching death.<\/li><li><strong>Poison
        (purple)<\/strong> - The character is poisoned and their health will slowly
        deplete.<\/li><\/ul><p>Besides the EKG, players may also note the character''s
        stance. If a character is in the Caution zone, they''ll hold their chest,
        but move at the same speed as if they were perfectly fine. On the other hand
        if they''re in the Danger zone they''ll hold their chest and limp, moving
        incredibly slower than before.<\/p><p>Carrying on the tradition set by the
        original Resident Evil, characters use a small variety of <a href=\"\/medical-herb\/3055-566\"
        data-ref-id=\"3055-566\">herbs<\/a> to heal themselves and cure poisons. <a
        href=\"\/first-aid-spray\/3055-619\" data-ref-id=\"3055-619\">First Aid Sprays<\/a>
        are also available, with the singular purpose of healing the character fully.
        There exist three types of herbs, all of which can be combined in some way
        for different degrees of healing:<\/p><ul><li><b>Green Herb<\/b> - On its
        own will restore 25% of health.<\/li><li><b>Blue Herb<\/b> - On its own will
        cure poison, though will no restore any health.<\/li><li><b>Red Herb<\/b>
        - On its own can do nothing.<\/li><li><b>Green + Green Herb<\/b> - Mixed will
        now heal roughly 50% of health.<\/li><li><b>Green + Green + Green Herb<\/b>
        - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of any poisons.<\/li><li><b>Green
        + Blue Herb<\/b> - Mixed will heal the character 25% and cure any poison.<\/li><li><b>Green
        + Green + Blue Herb<\/b> - Mixed will heal the character 50% and cure any
        poison.<\/li><li><b>Green + Red Herb<\/b> - Mixed will heal the character
        completely, though not of any poisons.<\/li><li><b>Green + Red + Blue Herb<\/b>
        - Mixed will heal the character completely, including Poisons.<\/li><li><b>Red
        + Blue Herb<\/b> - Mixed will do nothing.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Live Selection Choices<\/h3><p>During
        key moments in the game, Jill will be faced with a ''''Live Selection''''.
        These sequences temporarily stall the action and allow the player to decide
        how they''d like to react to a situation from two possible choices. More often
        than not these are based around Nemesis encounters. As time still progresses,
        albeit slowly, in these instances, the player is faced with the added pressure
        of a timer. If the player doesn''t choose quickly enough, a decision will
        be made for them -- usually inflicting damage upon Jill in the process.<\/p><p>A
        more detailed listing of the choices and their effects can be found further
        below.<\/p><h3><b>Ammo Crafting<\/b><\/h3><p>Gunpowder can now be collected
        in order for Jill to create her own ammo. This allows for the creation of
        different types of ammo that would not be available otherwise.<\/p><p>There
        are three individual types of gunpowder in Resident Evil 3; types A and B
        are found throughout the game and the only way obtain type C is by combining
        one pot of type A and B. By combining these gun powders with either the Reloading
        tool or standard grenade rounds, various types of ammunition can be created.<\/p><p>By
        combining the same kind of gun powder repeatedly with the Reloading tool you
        can create advanced ammo types for the handgun and shotgun. The number of
        pots used in a single combination will not affect the progression for obtaining
        the enhanced ammo, so in order to obtain them as quickly as possible it is
        best to use a single pot each time.<\/p><p>Below is a complete breakdown for
        combining every type of gun powder combination with both the Reloading Tool
        and Grenade Rounds as well as how many combinations is necessary to unlock
        the enhanced ammo. Difficulty will only affect the amount of ammo created,
        it does not have any effect on obtaining the upgraded ammo.<\/p><h4>Basic

        Resident Evil game pre-Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil 3 requires that players
        find one of the many typewriters located throughout the environments to save,
        and must also have at least one ink ribbon item in their character''s inventory.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><h3>Main

        of any use however. Nicholai reluctantly accepts Jill''s help and they all
        head out to search for the supplies needed. Throughout Jill''s search she
        will encounter Nicholai in either the gas station or the Management Office,
        depending on certain choices made by the player. Either way, Nicholai is presumed
        dead after an attack by zombies or by an explosion. After Jill helps repair

        this point the player takes control of Carlos and must travel to the hospital.
        Along the way, again determined by certain choices made by the player, Carlos
        will learn of Nicholai''s survival and also his true intentions either by
        another UBCS soldier - who is soon enough blown up by a trap set by Nicholai
        - or through Nicholai himself. It is revealed that he is one of the ''''Supervisors''''
        and was meant to observe the UBCS''s attempts to fight the BOW''s for combat-data.
        For extra cash, he is now killing off the remaining supervisors to be the
        sole survivor. After a brief encounter with a now mutated Nemesis, Carlos
        will concoct a vaccine and deliver it to Jill to bring her to full health.
        Carlos then mentions that there is ''something'' he has to do and leaves Jill
        in the chapel alone. The player then regains control of Jill.<\/p><p>Jill
        then travels through the Raccoon City park eventually encountering Nemesis
        once again. Nemesis attacks Jill causing her to flee into the nearby power
        plant. Jill will meet up with Carlos once more and will be filled in on information
        regarding the fate of Raccoon City. It has been decided that Raccoon City
        is to be levelled completely via a missile bombing, regardless of survivors,
        to try and contain the virus. Both Carlos and Jill opt to split-up and find
        any means of escaping.<\/p><p>Throughout Jill''s travels, she will once again
        encounter Nicholai. Either outside the dumping facility or piloting the last
        helicopter, to which he is either killed by the nemesis or by Jill. Another
        possibility is Nicholai may actually escape the city too. Regardless, Jill
        will encounter the Nemesis yet again in the waste room. Manipulating the pipes
        so they spew acid over Nemesis, Jill is able to beat the Nemesis to such an
        extent that he eventually loses near all of his limbs. Jill then manages to
        obtain an Umbrella scientist ID card and uses it to make her way to the radio
        room, to which she will either receive a broadcast from an ''old friend<i>''<\/i>
        should Nicholai manage to get to the last helicopter, or will be greeted by
        Carlos advising Jill to have hope.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\"

        of the default Nemesis, holding the corpse of Brad Vickers.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Nemesis
        is the most prominent and recurring boss battle the player will face. Initially,
        he is encountered in his trademark state wearing his huge leather jacket.
        He will be faced seven times during this iteration, though six of those can
        be avoided. The player can still face off against Nemesis, however, and may
        even be able to temporarily down him for the time being. Should the player
        be playing on the Hard mode setting, Nemesis will drop a reward each time
        he falls. He will usually rely on his brute strength to attack the player,
        punching and throwing Jill around with ease. However, he also has an attack
        where he grabs the character and then attempts to force his tentacle down
        their throat. This attack is tremendously powerful, and can kill the player
        when they''re in the <em>Caution<\/em> state.<\/p><p>Sometimes he will be
        equipped with his own personal rocket launcher, which as one would expect
        does a significant amount of damage if hit by a rocket. If close enough, he
        will still attack by using the launcher as a melee weapon, which does slightly
        more damage than his regular melee attacks. Ammunition for his launcher is
        limited, however, and after enough shots he will discard the launcher and
        revert back to his normal moveset. The option to flee is always there--minus
        the seventh, which forces the player to face him for story purposes--however
        Nemesis will give chase up until a point, and will even stalk the player through
        different rooms, which at the time was unheard of for the series. Running
        from Nemesis can prove to be just be difficult as fighting him, however, as
        he can catch up to the player with ease -- often with a quick punch that''ll
        do damage to the player. Fortunately he will only only ever use his right
        hand, so it is possible to read these patterns and avoid his attacks.<\/p><p>A
        minor variation of Nemesis'' original form can optionally be fought in the
        Clock Tower courtyard. This version of the Nemesis now has an exposed tentacle
        he''ll use as a whip for long distance. However, his standard move-set is
        still available and he largely requires the same tactics to best. However,
        this particular state of Nemesis is only faced depending on if the player
        decided to use the emergency brake whilst riding the runaway cable car, otherwise
        Jill will face the default Nemesis equipped with his rocket launcher.<\/p><h4>Nemesis

        the climactic battle in the courtyard, the successive damage inflicted by
        Jill and Carlos, and the fire he passed out in after the previous battle,
        Nemesis''s leather jacket has now been completely torn, exposing tentacles
        and boils that have formed across his body. The player will encounter this
        form of Nemesis at least twice; first as Carlos--and again as Jill if the
        player doesn''t do enough damage during his part of the story--and secondly
        for story purposes, where the player must use valves to spray acid on Nemesis.
        During this state, he relies greatly on his long range tentacle attacks and
        will make liberal use of his ability to grab the player and then slam them
        against the floor multiple times. If the player is in the <em>Caution<\/em>
        state, they may be killed outright by this attack. The boss battle against
        Nemesis'' second form nearly destroys him, as he quite literally falls apart
        after enough damage has been dealt.<\/p><h4>Nemesis (Final Form)<\/h4><figure

        is encountered in his third and final form at the end of the game. What remains
        of the monster will drop down to the ''''waste disposal'''' center, which
        houses numerous Tyrant models that have been discarded. Upon locating a mutated
        Tyrant model, it will begin to feed on it, allowing Nemesis to grow into a
        large, almost reptilian-like creature. This final form of Nemesis is practically
        invincible, and can only be defeated via the use of an experimental Railgun
        -- a weapon that is so powerful that it requires four huge batteries to power
        and around thirty seconds to fully charge.<\/p><h4>Gravedigger<\/h4><figure

        a giant worm, though one that has its head exposed to reveal a giant array
        of sharp teeth. The first encounter with Gravedigger is set within a small
        series of underground corridors. The player needs to press a series of buttons
        to lower the ladder to climb back up, whilst being in constant danger of having
        the worm pop out whenever the player gets close to one of the buttons. Through
        precise timing, the player can leave the area without ever having to fire
        a single shot. The alternative option is to instead attempt to ward off the
        worm, though this may take a fairly significant amount of ammunition.<\/p><p>Jill
        faces off against the giant worm a second time during the Raccoon Park section,
        now with no chance of avoiding a fight this time around. The graveyard where
        Jill encounters the worm is destroyed and has been transformed into a narrow
        path. The worm will hide underground most of the time, but will sporadically
        pop out to give chase and attack. There is a small puddle of water and an
        electrical light that the player may shoot to electrocute the worm for an
        instant kill, though it requires incredibly precise timing to pull off.<\/p><h4>Umbrella
        Helicopter<\/h4><p>An optional boss that can be encountered by choosing the
        appropriate Live Selection option at the end of the game. This was the first
        ever non-B.O.W. boss battle the series featured, and has Nicholai in a chopper
        equipped with duel miniguns. The battle plays out simply, with Jill given
        some slight cover to avoid the chopper''s miniguns, and is then tasked to
        return fire during the weapons'' cooldown period. If Jill takes too long to
        take Nicholai''s chopper down, he will manage to escape. The chopper is rather
        robust as well, and can withstand up to around 3-4 shots with the rocket launcher.<\/p><h2>Live

        the game, the player will find themselves in life-threatening situations that
        require split-second decisions. These encounters typically result in either
        evading Nemesis or using part of the environment to the player''s advantage
        to weaken him. Some, however, have a much larger effect on the game and can
        alter certain scenarios; one in particular will even determine the ending.<\/p><h3>Live
        Selection 1: R.P.D. Station<\/h3><p>Upon reaching the R.P.D. station courtyard
        for the first time, Nemesis brutally murders Brad Vickers before setting his
        sights towards Jill.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Fight with the monster: <\/strong>The
        scene immediately reverts back to standard gameplay. Despite the player''s
        option to fight Nemesis, they can still run into the police station through
        the front entrance, losing Nemesis in the process. This option can also prove
        useful for retrieving a S.T.A.R.S. ID card earlier than usual by collecting
        Brad''s from his corpse.<\/li><li><strong>Enter the police station:<\/strong>
        Avoids the first encounter with the Nemesis altogether.<\/li><li><strong>Do
        nothing:<\/strong> Nemesis attacks Jill and the scene will proceed as if the
        the first option had been chosen.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Live Selection 2-A: Restaurant<\/h3><p>This
        Live Selection can occur in two separate locations, although the ultimate
        results of both Live Selections are roughly identical. After meeting Carlos
        for the first time in the restaurant, their introduction is interrupted by
        the sudden arrival of Nemesis.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Run into the basement<\/strong>:
        After Jill and Carlos enter the restaurant''s basement, some water pipes will
        burst and begin flooding the room. Several zombies also appear here. Players
        can escape through a ventilation shaft leading outside, allowing the pair
        to temporarily evade Nemesis. However, if too much time passes while inside
        the flooding basement, Jill and Carlos will automatically climb back up the
        ladder and must confront Nemesis directly.<\/li><li><strong>Hide inside the
        kitchen<\/strong>: Jill locates a lit oil lantern and throws it at Nemesis.
        This will ignite the gas leak in the restaurant''s kitchen, temporarily knocking
        out Nemesis with an explosion. If playing on the Hard mode setting, Nemesis
        also drops a weapon case for the player to collect.<\/li><li><strong>Do nothing<\/strong>:
        This forces the player to fight against Nemesis with assistance from Carlos.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Live
        Selection 2-B: Newspaper Office<\/h3><p>This Live Selection can occur in two
        separate locations, although the ultimate results of both Live Selections
        are roughly identical. After meeting Carlos for the first time in the newspaper
        office, their introduction is interrupted by the sudden arrival of Nemesis.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Jump
        out of the window<\/strong>: Jill and Carlos leap through a nearby window
        to temporarily evade Nemesis. This option grants access to a locked back alley
        containing two Red Herbs.<\/li><li><strong>Hide in the back<\/strong>: While
        Jill and Carlos conceal themselves, Nemesis is knocked out by an explosion
        from an adjacent office. If playing on the Hard mode setting, Nemesis also
        drops a weapon case for the player to collect.<\/li><li><strong>Do nothing<\/strong>:
        This forces the player to fight against Nemesis with assistance from Carlos.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Live
        Selection 3: Power Plant<\/h3><p>At the power plant, Jill opens one of the
        shutters via a specific button combination at the controls, only to be startled
        by a horde of zombies banging against a nearby fence.<\/p><ul><li><b>Head
        to the emergency exit<\/b>: Initially too rusty to open, Jill will now instead
        barge through and escape outside, possibly with Nemesis awaiting.<\/li><li><b>Increase
        electricity output<\/b>: This will send a strong current through the fence
        causing all zombie heads to explode; the combination required to open the
        second shutter will have altered, however.<\/li><li><strong>Do nothing<\/strong>:
        The zombies will break through the fence and attack.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Live Selection
        4: Parking Garage<\/h3><p>While making her way through the parking garage,
        a sudden tremor causes the floor beneath Jill to crumble, leaving her dangling
        from the edge of a deep hole. Although she tries to hoist herself up, two
        heavy crates begin sliding out of the back of a nearby truck and directly
        towards Jill.<\/p><ul><li><strong><strong>Climb up<\/strong><\/strong>: Jill
        climbs up and avoids the sliding crates.<\/li><li><strong>Jump down<\/strong>:
        Jill jumps down and avoids the falling crates. She will then come across a
        giant dead worm and will have to climb up a ladder to leave the area, finding
        herself in the outer car park.<\/li><li><strong>Do nothing<\/strong>: The
        crates collide with Jill, sending her to the bottom of the hole as if she
        had jumped down herself. Jill also takes some damage.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Live
        Selection 5: Cable Car<\/h3><p>After Mikhail sacrifices himself to blow Nemesis
        out of the cable car with a grenade, Carlos loses control of the vehicle,
        which is now on a collision course with the Clock Tower.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Jump
        out of the window<\/strong>: Jill will dive out of the window landing just
        a little ways away from the Clock Tower; Carlos is seen to be still onboard
        the train as it crashes, however. This options set in motion the event of
        Carlos arriving to Jill''s side after she had fought Nemesis--equipped with
        his rocket launcher--on her own.<\/li><li><strong>Use the emergency brake<\/strong>:
        This has no effect and will leave Jill aboard the train as it crashes; Carlos
        can be seen jumping out of the window. This option sets in motion the event
        of Carlos arriving to fight Nemesis with Jill in the Clock Tower courtyard;
        he will be knocked unconscious by Nemesis, but will have at least been able
        to destroy his rocket launcher, dealing a noticeable amount of damage.<\/li><li><strong>Do
        nothing<\/strong>: The same result as the first option.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Live
        Selection 6: Clock Tower<\/h3><p>Just below the Clock Tower machinery room
        on an outside balcony, Jill will again be confronted by Nemesis.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Use
        the light<\/strong>: Jill turns on the searchlight, blinding Nemesis, and
        then pushes him off the balcony<\/li><li><strong>Use the cord<\/strong>: Jill
        throws the electrical cord into a puddle of water close to Nemesis, electrocuting
        him severely<i>. <\/i>This will leave Nemesis temporarily unconscious, but
        he will awake shortly after. If playing on Hard mode, Nemesis will also drop
        a weapon case.<\/li><li><strong>Do nothing<\/strong>: Nemesis will continue
        to advance towards Jill until the scene reverts back to normal gameplay.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Live
        Selection 7: Factory<\/h3><p>Jill''s way is blocked by Nemesis as she crosses
        a rickety bridge leading toward the abandoned factory.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Push
        him off<\/strong>: Jill will dodge an attack and then push Nemesis off the
        bridge into the water below. This sets in motion the ending of Nicholai being
        killed by Nemesis and Carlos finding the last helicopter.<\/li><li><strong>Jump
        off<\/strong>: Jill will dodge an attack and jump off the bridge landing near
        the sewer entrance to the facility. This sets in motion the ending of Nicholai
        reaching the helicopter and Barry Burton arriving to the rescue.<\/li><li><strong>Do
        nothing<\/strong>: Nemesis will knock Jill off the bridge setting in motion
        the same events of the second option, but with Jill also having taken some
        damage from the attack.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Live Selection 8: Helicopter<\/h3><p>This
        Live Selection only occurs if the player chose to jump off the bridge or do
        nothing during Live Selection 7. Jill discovers Nicholai attempting to escape
        from the Factory inside the last functional helicopter in the area.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Negotiate
        with Nicholai<\/strong>: Jill tries to reason with Nicholai about his actions
        and asks about his motives. Nicholai will answer but then fly away, escaping
        Raccoon City. This bit of dialogue will also be spoken by Nicholai just before
        he is killed by Nemesis in the scenario where Jill pushes Nemesis off the
        bridge.<\/li><li><b>Return fire to the chopper<\/b>: The player regains control
        and has the option to return fire at the helicopter, potentially killing Nicholai.
        If the player takes too long to destroy the helicopter, Nicholai will escape.<\/li><li><strong>Do
        nothing<\/strong>: Nicholai escapes.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Live Selection 9: Escape<\/h3><p>Following
        the destruction of Nemesis'' third form with the experimental railgun, what
        little of him remains crawls towards Jill in one final attempt to kill her.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Exterminate
        the monster<\/strong>: Jill dodges Nemesis'' acid-spit attack and retrieves
        a nearby .44 magnum. She unloads all six rounds into the quivering mass and
        puts an end to Nemesis once and for all.<\/li><li><b>Ignore it and evacuate<\/b>:
        Jill will continue her escape and head to the elevator.<\/li><li><strong>Do
        nothing<\/strong>: Nemesis spits acid at Jill, poisoning her before the monster
        finally dies from exhaustion. It reverts back to gameplay allowing the player
        to head onto the elevator. The poison attack by Nemesis has no effect on the
        overall ending.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Unlockables<\/h2><p>Like most Resident Evils,
        Resident Evil 3 has a huge assortment of unlockable features to add to the
        game''s replay value including weapons, costumes and a minigame to help prolong
        the game''s length.<\/p><p>There also exists <a href=\"\/resident-evil-3-nemesis\/3030-5587\/epilogues\/52-52744\"
        data-ref-id=\"3030-5587\">8 Epilogue stories<\/a> which give the player some
        insight into what the main characters were doing after their last Resident
        Evil game appearances. The epilogues give note to the upcoming games, <a href=\"..\/..\/resident-evil-code-veronica-x\/61-8402\/\"
        rel=\"nofollow\">Code Veronica<\/a> and <a href=\"..\/..\/resident-evil-4\/61-1578\/\"
        rel=\"nofollow\">Resident Evil 4<\/a>, and also gave players the first ever

        agent <a href=\"..\/..\/hunk\/94-3859\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">HUNK<\/a> without
        his helmet. Each Epilogue is unlocked after a single completion, requiring
        the player to complete Resident Evil 3: Nemesis 8 times to unlock them all.<\/p><p>Should
        the player manage to collect every file in order through the game, upon a
        new game will find Jill''s Diary added to their files. The file is as follows:<\/p><blockquote><p><i>''''August
        7th<\/i><\/p><p><i>Two weeks have passed since that day. My wounds have been
        healed, but I just can''t forget it. For most people, it''s history now. But
        for me, whenever I close my eyes, it all comes back clearly. Zombies eating
        people''s flesh and the screams of my teammates dying. No, the wounds in my
        heart are not healed yet...<\/i><\/p><p><i>August 13th<\/i><\/p><p><i>Chris
        has been causing a lot of trouble recently. What''s with him? He seldom talks
        to the other police members and is constantly irritated. The other day, he
        punched Elran of the Boy''s Crime department just for accidentally splashing
        Chris''s face with coffee. I immediately stopped Chris, but when he saw me
        he just gave me a wink and walked away. I wonder what happened to him...<\/i><\/p><p><i>August
        15th<\/i><\/p><p><i>Midnight. Chris, who has been on a leave of absence for
        a \"vacation,\" called me so I visited his apartment. As soon as I walked
        into his room, he showed me a couple of pieces of paper. They were part of
        a virus research report entitled as simply as \"G\". Then Chris told me that,
        \"The nightmare still continues.\" He went on to say that, \"It''s not over
        yet.\" Ever since that day, he has been fighting all by himself without rest,
        without even telling me...<\/i><\/p><p><i>August 24th<\/i><\/p><p><i>Chris
        left the town today to go to Europe. Barry told me that he would send his
        family to Canada and then he would follow Chris. I decided to remain in Raccoon
        City for a while because I know that the research facility in this city will
        be very important to this entire case. In a month or so, I''ll be joining
        with them somewhere in Europe. That''s when my real battle begins...''''<\/i><\/p><\/blockquote><h3>Alternate
        Costumes<\/h3><p>Much like past Resident Evil games, upon completion of RE3
        the player is given a letter rank ranging from D (worst) to S (best). It''s
        made up of varying factors such as how long it took to complete, how many
        first-aid sprays were used, and how often the player saved. These ranks would
        determine what costumes the player would unlock for any following playthroughs.<\/p><p>The
        costumes were attainable by first collecting the boutique key out of the inventory
        box, and then unlocking the boutique located near the bar early on. Inside
        are five dressing rooms, each with one of the available costumes. For the
        PC version, all costumes (including two extra) are unlocked from the outset
        and Jill''s costume is selected from the very start of the game.<\/p><figure

        Mad Jackal''s title screen<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>After a single completion
        of the game, Operation Mad Jackal becomes available. It has the player choose
        between the three mercenaries, Carlos Oliveira, Mikhail Victor and Nicholai
        Ginovaef -- each with their own distinctive weapon load-out that acts as the
        different difficulties. Mikhail being the easiest, followed by Carlos then
        Nicholai.<\/p><p>The objective is to make it from the fortified train to the
        warehouse save room. There is, however, a ticking down timer which is based
        upon a bomb being placed within the mercenaries. To gain more time, the player
        can kill enemies as well as save hostages - which will reward players with
        some added supplies. Upon completion, the mercenary is beckoned by a shadowy
        figure who asks his female associate to hand an <a href=\"\/umbrella-corporation\/3015-204\"
        data-ref-id=\"3015-204\">Umbrella<\/a> marked briefcase, which contains the
        player''s cash reward. Even if the player fails due to death, or expiration
        of time, they are still marked with a rank and given a cash sum. The mode
        was conceived by <a href=\"\/yasuhisa-kawamura\/3040-32989\" data-ref-id=\"3040-32989\">Yasuhisa
        Kawamura<\/a>, and the design was inspired by <em>The Running Man<\/em> film.<\/p><p>The
        enemies encountered are all pulled from the main story-line, including multiple
        encounters with the notorious Nemesis, which sometimes even includes him alongside
        other BOW creatures as well. One such quirk the minigame features is a section
        that is patrolled by two Nemesis''s - each equipped with a rocket launcher.
        Through careful manipulation, it''s possible to actually force the two Nemesis''s
        to duke it out if the player manoeuvres well enough so one Nemesis may accidentally
        shoot or attack the other.<\/p><p>Completion of the game will award the player
        a rank between D to S as well a cash sum, which can then be used to purchase
        the unlockable weapons for the main game and the option to have infinite ammo
        for all weapons in the main game.<\/p><h4>The Mercenaries<\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\"

        is. The way to save them is to kill all enemies within the area, then to press
        the action button next to the hostage. All hostages are characters taken from
        the story, and the final two are whichever two other mercenaries that are
        remaining, after the player''s selected character. A hidden timer also persists
        for each hostage as well, which, if expired, will have the player arrive to
        find the hostage killed. A quick way for players to determine if a hostage
        is dead before they reach the body is to note the lack of any opposition within
        the room the hostage was kept; if there are no enemies in the room, then this
        signifies that the hostage was killed.<\/p><p>The list of the hostages and

        The standard version of the game. Whereas the first two games had separate
        editions for DualShock controls, the standard version of Resident Evil 3 came
        with DualShock controls by default.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><strong>PC<\/strong>:
        While the PC version includes higher-resolution character models, the backgrounds
        and cutscenes are lower-resolution. This version allowed the player to pick
        Jill''s costumes from the New Game option and featured two new costumes. It
        also had the Mercenaries mode unlocked at the main menu from the start.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><strong>Dreamcast<\/strong>:
        Often considered the best version of the game. It features high resolution
        character models and backgrounds. The cutscenes are in high resolution. Like
        the PC version, the player is able to play Mercenaries mode immediately and
        also pick Jill''s costumes immediately. Like Resident Evil 2 and <a href=\"\/resident-evil-code-veronica\/3030-13940\"
        data-ref-id=\"3030-13940\">Resident Evil: CODE: Veronica<\/a> on Dreamcast,
        the VMU displays the character''s health.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><strong>GameCube<\/strong>:
        Technically, the game is a port of the PlayStation version, which doesn''t
        have any content unlocked from the start. It does, however, have the high
        resolution character models and backgrounds like the Dreamcast version.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Soundtrack<\/h2><p>The
        soundtrack for Resident Evil 3: Nemesis was released in September 22th, 2009
        in Japan. Later, versions for Europe and USA were also released. The original

        data-ref-id=\"3030-5842\"> Resident Evil<\/a>. This version was released 18
        months after the original and featured some new elements. The major feature
        added was the game mode, Arrange Game, in which the main quest items and weapons
        are moved around, with a few additional alterations. Such notable differences
        include the corpse of <a href=\"\/forest-speyer\/3005-4246\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4246\">Forest

        would come equipped with a custom Beretta M9 handgun. It had a faster firing
        rate than the original beretta and has a chance to score a critical hit, which
        in the case of a zombie would completely destroy the head.<\/p><p>The Director''s
        Cut edition had two discs, with one being a full demo of the upcoming sequel,

        Capcom<\/a> had to delay at the time. The main purpose of the Director''s
        Cut edition was in fact to tide fans over due to the rather large delay. This
        version of the game hit America in September of 1997, and had a slightly different
        cover shot. In 1998 the \"Greatest Hits\" version of Resident Evil: Director''s
        Cut released at a discounted price and featured completely brand new cover
        art, with a bloody faced zombie looking over his shoulder.<\/p><p>The Dualshock

        comes in contact with the character. Once combat begins, a bar with a slider
        appears at the bottom of the screen, representing the player''s aim. Enemies
        are damaged when the player attacks while the slider moves over the bar representing
        the enemy, and timing is key. The center of the enemy''s bar can be attacked
        for critical damage. The player controls up to three characters at once, with
        the ability to switch characters and enter the item screen without pausing
        the battle.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><p>Following the destruction of Raccoon City,

        (B.O.W.) that is said to be on the ocean liner, Starlight. Contact with Leon
        is lost, and Barry Burton is sent in to find Leon and eliminate the B.O.W.<\/p><p>Soon
        after arrival, Barry discovers the passengers have become zombies. A scream
        let''s Barry know that at least one person is still alive. The scream comes
        from a girl named Lucia, who is being chased by the B.O.W. Barry tries to
        protect her, but the B.O.W. manages to capture her.<\/p><p>Barry finds Leon,
        catches him up with what''s going on, and they go after the girl and manage
        to rescue her. Soon after, an explosion threatens to sink the ship. Leon and
        Lucia go off to activate the sprinkler system, while Barry attempts to communicate
        with headquarters for an air lift.<\/p><p>After successfully activating the
        sprinklers, Leon and Lucia find their way back to Barry. However, as they
        reunite, the two of them overhear Barry making a deal to sell Lucia to Umbrella.
        Leon confronts him, and Barry pulls a gun on Leon and takes Lucia captive.<\/p><p>Barry
        takes Lucia to an Umbrella submarine that is waiting for him. Before he can
        go after her, another explosion rocks the ship, and Leon runs to attempt to
        repair the damage. He finds the B.O.W., fights it off, but learns there is
        no hope for the ship.<\/p><p>On board, the captain tells him that there is
        a parasite in Lucia that will turn her into a new B.O.W. in ten days. Barry
        reveals his deal was simply a deception to get on board the submarine, and
        he forces the submarines surgeons to remove the parasite. Unfortunately, the
        parasite escapes, and infects the inhabitants of the sub, and Barry and Lucia
        are forced to flee back to the sinking ship.<\/p><p>The two of them find what
        appears to be Leon, but it turns out the new B.O.W.s are shape-shifters. They
        escape and find the real Leon in the engine room. They return to the top deck
        to confront the B.O.W., and it pulls Lucia into the sea. Barry rescues her,
        but then another Lucia appears. Lucia cuts her hand, revealing red blood,
        as opposed to the green blood of the B.O.W., and the three of them make a
        final stand.<\/p><p>The three of them are rescued, and Lucia is offered a
        place to live in Barry''s home. The final scene shows green blood dripping
        from Leon''s neck.<\/p>","expected_release_day":null,"expected_release_month":null,"expected_release_quarter":null,"expected_release_year":null,"id":15710,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/1\/13692\/914020-resevil.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/13692\/914020-resevil.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/1\/13692\/914020-resevil.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/13692\/914020-resevil.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/1\/13692\/914020-resevil.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/1\/13692\/914020-resevil.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/1\/13692\/914020-resevil.jpg"},"name":"Resident

        Chronicles is an<a href=\"\/on-rails-gameplay\/3015-2893\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2893\">
        on-rails shooter<\/a> based in the <a href=\"\/resident-evil\/3025-397\" data-ref-id=\"3025-397\">
        Resident Evil<\/a> universe, exclusively for the<a href=\"\/wii\/3045-36\"
        data-ref-id=\"3045-36\"> Wii<\/a>. The game contains a number of scenarios
        from past games, ranging from <a href=\"\/resident-evil-zero\/3030-10247\"
        data-ref-id=\"3030-10247\"> Resident Evil Zero<\/a>, the original game, to

        Resident Evil 3<\/a>. A number of previously unseen sequences assist in exploring
        and filling out numerous areas in the plot to make them more compatible with
        later installments. It is worth noting that not everything presented in the
        game is compatible with the original games'' plot, as much of the game has
        been retrofitted to allow the two main characters in each of the three main
        scenarios to accompany one another throughout.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>The
        game follows the usual model utilized in other on-rails shooters, as well
        as allowing for two-player co-op play on all of the primary scenarios. The
        bonus scenarios are single-player only until <a href=\"\/cooperative-play\/3015-108\"
        data-ref-id=\"3015-108\"> co-op play <\/a>is unlocked for them (upon completion
        of Hunk''s final mission). <a href=\"\/grenade\/3055-111\" data-ref-id=\"3055-111\">
        Grenades<\/a> and weapon changing are commonplace in the game, allowing players
        to fight through the <a href=\"\/zombie\/3015-79\" data-ref-id=\"3015-79\">
        zombie<\/a> hordes in a number of different ways. <a href=\"\/counter-system\/3015-867\"
        data-ref-id=\"3015-867\"> Counter-attacks<\/a> are available to each character
        upon specific conditions, and allow for quick disposals of enemies.<\/p><p>Enemies
        require quite a few bullets to down, and headshots are occasionally generated
        from your efforts, which usually results in said zombies head exploding in
        glorifying fashion. This also gives you a \"<a href=\"\/critical-hit\/3015-97\"
        data-ref-id=\"3015-97\"> critical hit<\/a>\" which is tallied into your point
        total at the end of each scenario. The boss battles in the game are, more
        or less, taken completely from the sections they are based upon. Some notable
        battles include those against the Tyrant which takes place in the same spot
        as it did in the original on top of the roof, after lowering his health enough
        a rocket launcher is also dropped for you to use in order to finish him off
        just as in the original as well. One of the more difficult boss'' would have
        to be plant 42 in the mansion incident. It is explained early on in the game
        that all enemies have their weak spot (which is indicated by the white square
        like <a href=\"\/crosshair\/3015-638\" data-ref-id=\"3015-638\"> crosshair<\/a>
        appearing in the middle of the usual\/actual crosshair), but there are few
        times in the battle with plant 42 that its weak spot is actually shootable,
        and many rounds of counter attacking and dodging are involved in order to
        beat it. Just like in Resident Evil 4 there are many times in which the player
        is lead to believe they are in a <a href=\"\/cutscene\/3015-22\" data-ref-id=\"3015-22\">
        cutscene<\/a> but in fact must have the controller at the ready in order to
        push any number of button combinations in order to avoid <a href=\"\/instant-death\/3015-740\"

        let these monkeys out of the cage <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Sometimes this
        comes in the form of shaking the controller from left to right in order to
        dodge an attack, or rapidly tapping the a or b buttons. There are also different
        paths that can be chosen in certain levels, usually leading the player to
        areas with bountiful <a href=\"\/ammo\/3055-533\" data-ref-id=\"3055-533\">
        ammunition<\/a> and <a href=\"\/health\/3015-130\" data-ref-id=\"3015-130\">
        health<\/a> items. To find and traverse into these areas the player usually
        has to shoot a broken down looking door, or just an open are where the \"press
        a\" action icon appears. A number of liberties are taken with the settings
        and the characters present, but the spirit remains intact. At the end of each
        level you are graded on your performance, much like in other resident evil
        games. You are given your grade rating and a certain number of stars based
        on the rating. The things taken into account for each rating are, enemy hits,
        critical hits, time taken, objects destroyed and files collected. After receiving
        your grade and star points, you are then able to customize any weapons currently
        available in your arsenal. You can upgrade overall ammo capacity, chamber
        capacity, and damage. each weapon can be upgraded up to four times, ending
        at level 4. It should also be noted that if you pick up any of the weapons
        in a level they will retain their increased abilities. Which is nice because
        at the start of each level you are only able to select one additional weapon,
        but are able to carry as many as you may find throughout the level. The archive
        is where you go to read any and all of the files you collect throughout each
        scenario. These include notes on the umbrella corps, S.T.A.R.S team members,
        and all the T-Virus modified creatures you come across.<\/p><h2>Plot<\/h2><p>The
        game opens with the beginning of Resident Evil 0, and places players in the
        shoes of S.T.A.R.S. rookie <a href=\"\/rebecca-chambers\/3005-1306\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1306\">Rebecca
        Chambers<\/a> or exiled marine Billy Coen. The story follows these characters
        through the training facility, and then proceeds to the events in the original
        title. <a href=\"\/chris-redfield\/3005-413\" data-ref-id=\"3005-413\">Chris
        Redfield<\/a> and <a href=\"\/jill-valentine\/3005-626\" data-ref-id=\"3005-626\">Jill
        Valentine<\/a> are the primary players here, and it deviates from the original
        game in a major way in the fact that they are not split up as they originally
        were. Given, it can be attributed to the two-player gameplay, but it''s sure
        to knack die-hard fans. Resident Evil 3: Nemesis is taken to next, following
        Jill once more as she teams up with Umbrella contractor Carlos Olivera as
        they attempt to flee the city as it''s ravaged by the <a href=\"\/t-virus\/3015-42\"
        data-ref-id=\"3015-42\">T-Virus<\/a>. The titular boss, <a href=\"\/nemesis\/3005-3189\"
        data-ref-id=\"3005-3189\">Nemesis<\/a>, is back and in full force.<\/p><p>In
        addition to a number of supplemental chapters interspersed throughout the
        game, another is introduced in an attempt to assist in bridging the plot between
        the original installments with that of <a href=\"\/resident-evil-4\/3030-1578\"
        data-ref-id=\"3030-1578\">Resident Evil 4<\/a>. This primary scenario has

        Redfield making her Mercenaries debut.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Mercenaries
        3D''s gameplay functions much like it did in Resident Evil 5, however instead
        of being presented with a series of stages to choose from there are now ''''Missions''''.
        Tiered across 5 sets, with an ''EX'' set at the very bottom, they are each
        set on a pre-determined stage with certain variables in place.<\/p><p>However
        they more often than not follow the classic design of dropping the player
        into the environment, with the goal to score as many points as possible by
        killing enemies within the time-limit. Time bonuses are typically scattered
        throughout for the player to destroy with a melee attack, which will provide
        additional time, though how much time varies between 30, 60, 90, and 120 seconds
        depending on which time bonus it is--however they all look the same--and what
        mission.<\/p><p>Melee attacks are still in play, and once again function as
        contextual button prompts once an enemy has been staggered. However there
        are different melee attacks depending on where the enemy was shot, and from
        what direction the player performs the attack. Killing an enemy with a melee
        attack will also provide a 5 second bonus to the timer.<\/p><p>Killing enemies
        in quick succession will initiate a combo meter, which will rise up by 1 per
        kill. The bigger the combo the player can attain before it dissipates the
        bigger the points bonus. There are also chests located in the environment
        that''ll provide a 30 second combo boost whence opened, that will then reward
        players with 1000 additional points per combo kill during those 30 seconds.<\/p><p>Once
        the mission objective has been met--or the timer has ran out--players will
        then be graded between D-SS. However if players die then they receive no rank,
        but are at least given the option to retry the mission.<\/p><h3>Controls &amp;
        Inventory<\/h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10354\/2670632-mercenaries_3d_-_chainsaw_majini.jpg\"

        of the returning sub-bosses, the Chainsaw Majini.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>On
        the surface the game largely resembles how Resident Evil 4 &amp; 5''s Mercenaries
        game played, as a third-person shooter with an over-the-shoulder perspective.
        However the most notary difference is players can now, to a degree, move and
        shoot\/reload. While holding the L button down, the character will lock their
        laser-sight aim into position, but will then be able to move while shooting.
        This does, however, greatly limit the player''s ability to aim their weapon.
        Though players can still move while reloading without the need to hold down
        L.<\/p><p>Character inventory works differently as well. Thanks to the 3DS''
        double-screen, the character''s inventory will now show up on the bottom screen
        indefinitely, along with the stage map. Each character has access to at most
        three weapons, each of which can be selected with the d-pad, or can alternatively
        be selected by pressing on the weapon''s icon on the screen itself. The touchscreen
        method can also be used to reload the weapon prematurely, though pressing
        the B button while aiming will also do as such.<\/p><p>Useable explosives
        such as grenades and landmines are now determined by the mission itself rather
        than the character. Combat knifes are also similarly restricted, in that only
        Jill Valentine and Jack Krauser have access to one (each with their own knife
        fighting style) and it functions as its own selectable weapon from the inventory
        as opposed to being able to be pulled out with its own dedicated button.<\/p><p>While
        each character starts off with their own pre-determined inventory loadout,
        additional healing &amp; ammo supplies can be located in destructible barrels
        or most commonly dropped from defeated enemies.<\/p><p>The game by default
        will force the player into a first-person view while aiming their weapon,
        however players can choose to switch to the classic third-person view in the
        options. They can also choose the color--red, blue, green, and white--of their
        laser-sight as well. Each character has a taunt animation that can be initiated
        by pressing X, however it provides no mechanical benefit.<\/p><h3>Health &amp;
        Healing<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10354\/2670634-mercenaries_3d_-_rebecca_gameplay_6.jpg\"

        Chambers armed with a grenade.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>A character''s health
        bar is designed exactly like how it was in Resident Evil 5. It is represented
        by 3\/4''s of a circle, and should it drop into the final 4th will then send
        the player into the Dying state. During this state the player cannot attack
        and can only very slowly limp, making the player extremely vulnerable. To
        get out of it a player must rapidly tap the Y button until it has been filled
        in.<\/p><p>While most attacks will do base damage, there are certain enemies
        that can perform instant-kill attacks regardless of a player''s condition,
        such as the Super Salvador sub-boss or The Executioner. Though The Executioner
        will first have to grab the player, which will then initiate a QTE forcing
        the player to press the face-button prompts in the correct order to escape.
        This same style of QTE will occur should players be grabbed by a regular Ganado\/Majini
        enemy as well, though failing a regular enemy QTE will simply force the character
        to withstand more damage as opposed to instantly-killing them.<\/p><p>Healing
        has been greatly simplified and only offers one item of use, green herbs.
        They have their item slot in the bottom screen inventory and can stack as
        many as the player can collect. While they too can be used by pressing their
        icon on the bottom screen, players can otherwise press A to immediately use
        a herb, which while healing the character will also make the character invulnerable
        to attacks for a few short seconds due to the invincibility-frames during
        the animation.<\/p><h3>Duo Mode<\/h3><p>As in Resident Evil 5, Mercenaries
        3D can be played cooperatively for up to two players. Players can either create
        their own lobby or search for one themselves, including whether or not the
        lobby will be open for all or exclusively for Friends.<\/p><p>When playing
        cooperatively players can now heal one another when close by, though this
        added benefit also comes with a price, in that should a player fall into the
        dying state they now require the aid of their partner to get out of it, otherwise
        they will die. Melee attacks can also be chained together as well.<\/p><p>Scores
        attained in Duo Mode are kept separate from scores when playing single-player.<\/p><h3>Skills<\/h3><p>A
        new feature for the Mercenaries minigame are <a href=\"\/perks\/3015-366\"
        data-ref-id=\"3015-366\">Skills<\/a>, which function as passive buffs the
        player can equip. There are 30 Skills in all and up to 3 can be equipped at
        once, however not all are available at the outset and must be unlocked by
        playing through the game. Skills can also be levelled up through use up to
        a Level 3; when they reach Level 3 they will provide an additional benefit
        besides the base one.<\/p><p>A list of Skills is as follows:<\/p><ul><li><strong>Medic<\/strong>

        4. In an interview with Eurogamer, Resident Evil producer <a href=\"\/masachika-kawata\/3040-32929\"

        couldn''t make his appearance in Mercenaries.\"<\/p><p>Not only does the reasoning
        make no sense, but it is also contradictory to the fact that Claire Redfield

        enemies and sub-bosses encountered across Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil

        makes a couple of appearances as a special enemy the player must kill.<\/p><p>All

        Evil 5, they will no longer be encountered with firearms. Similar to sub-boss
        enemies, there''s a good chance that upon death a Soldier Majini will begin

        insect-like creature. It is exceptionally weak and will typically die from
        a single shot. Its only form of attack is to launch itself at the player character
        and wrap around them; this in doing so will force the player to only walk
        without any means of attack. To escape the player must tap the face-button
        prompts as they appear.<\/p><p> <\/p><h3>Chicken<\/h3><p>Like their appearance
        in Resident Evil 5''s Mercenary modes, chickens will be encountered throughout
        the levels. They will usually avoid the player and flee once combat erupts
        around them, however they have been known to on occasion attack the player
        by leaping at them, though the damage they inflict is minimal. Killing a chicken
        will always reward the player with two herbs to collect, and will also add
        to a player''s combo.<\/p><h3>Ganado &amp; Majini Mutations<\/h3><p>Upon withstanding
        so much damage, there is a chance that the Ganado and Majini enemies may mutate
        into something further. However whether they have the capability or not is
        determined by the Mission. Throwing a flashbang will kill any mutated enemies
        within the vicinity instantly.<\/p><h4>Cephalo<\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\"

        no longer make use of any weapons they previously used and will instead use
        the plagas almost akin to a whip to swipe the player. Because of the many
        skittering legs that litter the plagas, simply being too close to the mutated
        Majini can inflict damage without the Majini actually initiating an attack.
        Damage to the plagas host is now largely ineffective, and the Majini from
        then on is most vulnerable by shooting the plagas itself.<\/p><h4>Duvalia<\/h4><figure

        shell, but given the chance should the player get close enough will open its
        shell and chomp the player, instantly placing the player in the dying state.
        The only way to kill it without a flashbang is to shoot the lower regions
        of the Majini, forcing the Duvalia to fall onto its knees with the shell open,
        then shooting the inside.<\/p><h3>Sub-Bosses<\/h3><h4>Executioner Majini<\/h4><figure

        that, the Executioner may also pick up the player forcing them to tap the
        face-button prompts as they show to escape. If unsuccessful, the Executioner
        throws the player to the ground and will execute and kill the player instantly
        - ignoring the dying state completely. Their other main attack is to swing
        the hammer left to right, with a slam in between each pair of swings.<\/p><p>While

        a particular resemblance to the ''J.J.'' Ganado from Resident Evil 4, Gatling
        Gun Majini''s are stocky Majini equipped with, like their name implies, gatling
        guns. They primarily attack by way of their gatling gun to rip through any
        players they manage to catch within their fire, though they will also use
        the gatling gun to smack the player away should they get close enough.<\/p><h4>Big

        highly acute hearing. Upon noticing the player it will rush to their vicinity
        and madly swing around the area. Their other most notable attack is their
        charging lunge attack, to which will kill a player instantly should they get
        caught by it. It may alternatively result in the Garrador getting its claw
        stuck into a wall, allowing the player some easy shots at its weak-point located
        on its back.<\/p><p>When attacked with explosives such as grenades, it may

        It has a huge chainsaw made up of two smaller ones tied together, and it will
        continually swing the chainsaw as it moves throughout the area. It''s surprisingly
        fast and its chainsaw has a fair bit of reach; any attack from Super Salvador

        only boss monster in the game, the creature''s attack patterns will switch
        between chasing the player on the ground, and hounding the player from the
        air. Popokarimu''s front is impenetrable from gunfire, though the rear of
        its tail is highly vulnerable. When close enough to its front, it will also
        swipe at the player with its front claws. Most of its attacks can be avoided
        by way of a QTE.<\/p><p>The most suitable strategy is for the player to lay
        down mines; after the Popokarimu comes in vicinity, the explosion will knock
        it over giving the player ample time to fire at its weak point.<\/p><h2>Missions<\/h2><p>There

        Evil: Outbreak File #2 is the sequel to the original <a href=\"\/resident-evil-outbreak\/3030-576\"
        data-ref-id=\"3030-576\">Resident Evil: Outbreak<\/a> game, which itself was
        the first in the series to provide online multi-player. The sequel once again
        allows for up to four players to co-operatively battle the T-Virus outbreak
        and the mayhem it has wrought. All eight characters from the original game
        have returned, mostly in the same forms they inhabited just a year earlier
        when the original was released. With only a year of development time for the
        game, there were not significant upgrades in terms of graphics, but a number
        of gameplay features (as well as the online play) were given robust makeovers.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>Not
        much changed between the two Resident Evil: Outbreak games in terms of gameplay.
        One of the most requested features was the ability to strafe and shoot at
        the same time, something that had never been available in the series. Surprisingly,
        it was actually added in this instalment. The virus meter from the original
        returns without much change, but the overall gameplay scheme saw a number
        of welcome additions (such as a decrease in load times).<\/p><p>Unfortunately,
        there are no new characters, but every character from the original is present,
        and they all are given a secondary specialty item this time around. <a href=\"\/kevin-ryman\/3005-1568\"
        data-ref-id=\"3005-1568\">Kevin<\/a> and <a href=\"\/mark-wilkins\/3005-1570\"
        data-ref-id=\"3005-1570\">Mark<\/a> are given additional magazines for their
        starting weapons, while <a href=\"\/alyssa-ashcroft\/3005-1573\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1573\">Alyssa<\/a>
        is given a self-defence weapon in the Stun Gun. <a href=\"\/yoko-suzuki\/3005-1471\"
        data-ref-id=\"3005-1471\">Yoko<\/a> and <a href=\"\/jim-chapman\/3005-1574\"
        data-ref-id=\"3005-1574\">Jim<\/a> receive \"luck\" items in their Buddhist
        Charm and Lucky Coin, respectively. <a href=\"\/david-king\/3005-1569\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1569\">David<\/a>
        is given a lighter to better suit his combinations, while <a href=\"\/george-hamilton\/3040-91179\"
        data-ref-id=\"3040-91179\">George<\/a> is given a capsule shooter for his
        field medic practices. Finally, <a href=\"\/cindy-lennox\/3005-1454\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1454\">Cindy<\/a>
        is given a bandage to further heal teammates.<\/p><p>The five new scenarios
        in the game are all new and much more expansive than those found in the original.
        The environments are vast, with some familiar and some foreign to series veterans.
        There is a training scenario as well, which reuses assets from the first scenario
        in the original game. The environments are varied as well, taking place at
        Raccoon City Zoo, in the subway system, in the wilderness of the Arklay Forest,
        at the R.P.D. precinct, and an Umbrella research laboratory.<\/p><p>An ever
        higher difficulty was added as Nightmare Mode, which challenged even the most
        seasoned veterans to survive the outbreak.<\/p><h3>Scenarios<\/h3><p>The sequel
        was again comprised of five base scenarios, as well as an additional training
        area that was based on the original game''s opening location.<\/p><h4>Training
        Area: Outbreak Revisited<\/h4><p>A training area intended to teach those new
        to the game the tricks of the trade. Based on the first scenario of the original
        game. Notes laid about within the opening area of the bar served to communicate
        various techniques to novice players.<\/p><h4>Wild Things<\/h4><p>All is not
        well at the Raccoon City Zoo when the band of survivors arrive at its back
        gate. Access is gained to the zoo itself by breaking into it, but this doesn''t
        seem like the greatest choice, as players begin to find terrifying transformations
        caused on the zoo''s non-human inhabitants by way of the T-virus, including
        a horrific boss fight against an infected <a href=\"\/elephant\/3015-2336\"
        data-ref-id=\"3015-2336\">elephant<\/a>.<\/p><h4>Underbelly<\/h4><p>The subway
        is where the survivors find themselves next as they attempt to escape through
        the underground tram station. New, more versatile enemies await in the darkness,
        and a player is even taken captive when the boss makes its appearance.<\/p><h4>Flashback<\/h4><p>The
        lush wilderness of the Arklay Forest has our survivors confused, as they look
        for potential escape routes in the forest. As they ponder this in an old abandoned
        cabin, an old man appears and speaks of a path just beyond the woods that
        leads to a bordering town. The man soon disappears, but instead of going to
        the border town, the group finds their way to an isolated and seemingly abandoned
        hospital. Fear strikes soon enough, as players find they are not alone when
        a masked axeman begins stalking them throughout the establishment.<\/p><h4>Desperate
        Times<\/h4><p>Familiar faces and areas are abound in this scenario, as players
        find themselves exploring the very police department found in the second and
        third games. <i>Resident Evil 2<\/i> players especially will take notice of
        officer Marvin Branagh and journalist Ben Bertolucci. Occurring before <i>Resident
        Evil 2<\/i>, there are a number of incidents that serve as preludes to the
        game, including a subtle cameo by two now-legendary characters in the franchise.<\/p><h4>End
        of the Road<\/h4><p>The longest scenario in the game, End of the Road combines
        a number of elements from the previous scenarios into one epic conclusion.
        The team has found their way into a research laboratory run by none other
        than Umbrella, but their timing seems especially unfortunate when a lockdown
        goes into<\/p><h3>Online Play<\/h3><p>The structure of the online play changed
        drastically in the sequel. New industry-sponsored events (from various gaming
        magazines) were present in the opening months of the game. The event system
        was overhauled, as was the old lobby system. The way players went about finding
        games changed as well, as there were now ten different areas to inhibit. The
        game remained broadband-only, like its predecessor, and had a far smaller
        user base.<\/p><p>The most criticized exclusion from the original returned
        in the sequel. There was, once more, no voice or in-game text chat, which
        forced players to communicate with only predetermined motions and ad-libs.
        This system was upgraded somewhat, but clearly not enough to appease those
        dismayed by the lack of real communication.<\/p><p>The North American online
        servers for the game ceased operation on March 31st, 2007. This was actually
        several months prior to the shutdown of the original game.<\/p><h2>Plot<\/h2><p>Once
        again, the game has an original group of survivors travelling throughout <a
        href=\"\/raccoon-city\/3035-73\" data-ref-id=\"3035-73\">Raccoon City<\/a>
        after the <a href=\"\/t-virus\/3015-42\" data-ref-id=\"3015-42\">T-virus<\/a>
        outbreak that eventually led to the destruction of the city. The five new
        scenarios are interspersed throughout areas in Raccoon City, and range from
        a T-virus-afflicted zoo to the Raccoon Police Department Headquarters building
        from <a href=\"\/resident-evil-2\/3030-9418\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9418\">Resident
        Evil 2<\/a> and <a href=\"\/resident-evil-3-nemesis\/3030-5587\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5587\">Resident
        Evil 3: Nemesis<\/a>, as well as a number of new areas.<\/p><h2>Characters<\/h2><p>The
        game features the eight characters from the original game, who each had diverse
        capabilities and uses. Every character has a unique item at the start of the
        game in their inventory, as well as an additional bonus item. Aside from this,
        the characters remain mostly identical to how they were in the original title.<\/p><h3><a

        is a third person shooter with an emphasis on 4-player cooperative teamwork
        and online play, as popularized by <a href=\"\/left-4-dead\/3025-1342\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1342\">Left
        4 Dead<\/a>. Though multiplayer is the recommended way to play, the main campaign
        can still be played offline with three other AI characters. In addition to
        Campaign mode, which is the only cooperative mode of play, there are four
        competitive modes for online play: Team Attack, Biohazard, Survivor, and Heroes
        (see below for mode descriptions).<\/p><p>Following up from Resident Evil
        games such <a href=\"\/resident-evil-outbreak-file-2\/3030-15222\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15222\">Outbreak

        players can shoot\/aim and move around at the same time, as well as run while
        reloading. The game also has a cover mechanic and overall plays very similarly
        to titles from the <a href=\"\/socom-us-navy-seals\/3025-628\" data-ref-id=\"3025-628\">SOCOM<\/a>
        franchise; Slant Six Games developed <a href=\"\/socom-us-navy-seals-confrontation\/3030-20676\"

        recent games in the RE series, the camera follows your character with an over-the-shoulder

        the character''s head still in view on the side of the screen, unless the
        weapon has a scope in which case a screen-filling scoped view appears. Each
        playable character has a unique and devastating melee finishing move and five
        unique abilities that can be unlocked and upgraded. Health in Operation Raccoon
        City does not regenerate--instead you must find and use <a href=\"\/green-herb\/3055-110\"

        time a zombie bites a character, there is a chance of that character contracting
        the zombie infection. When a character becomes infected, their health begins
        rapidly draining away. If an infected player dies, they player loses all control
        of their character as it rapidly mutates into a feral zombie and attacks their
        surviving teammates, forcing former comrades to gun it down to survive. The
        only way to cure infection before death is using an Antiviral Spray, which
        can be found just like First Aid Sprays scattered about maps.<\/p><p>There
        are two playable opposing factions in the game, the USS and Spec-Ops, as well
        as hordes of zombies who attack everyone. Many maps feature all three of these
        side fighting warring at once. Each of the two factions has a squad of six
        different playable characters. You start off each match by choosing a character,
        one of that character''s active abilities, a primary weapon, and a sidearm.
        Each character has two passive abilities (such as faster movement speed) that
        are always in effect while playing as that character and three active abilities
        (such as planting a trip mine), but only one active ability can be equipped
        at a time. Any character can equip any primary weapon and sidearm, as long
        as you have unlocked them.<\/p><p>Completing games in both campaign mode (singleplayer
        and co-op) and versus mode (online competitive) earns you <a href=\"\/experience-points\/3015-39\"
        data-ref-id=\"3015-39\">experience points<\/a> which form a simple persistent
        leveling system for unlocking new weapons and character abilities. The XP
        works as a universal currency in the game and is not character- or gamemode-specific.
        You initially only have four primary weapons (out of 20 total) and one sidearm
        (out of five total) unlocked to use. Each character can equip any weapon that
        you have yet unlocked without restriction. All characters begin with all of
        their five unique abilities locked. After being unlocked, each ability can
        be further upgraded two more times to incrementally increase its effects.<\/p><h2>Characters<\/h2><figure

        went unabated. In 2012, Capcom producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi stated that they
        would consider remaking Resident Evil 2 if there was enough demand from fans.
        Though despite this claim, it would take until 2014 for any further hints
        of the possibility of an RE2 remake to surface. On August 5th, 2014, a remastering
        of the original remake was announced for PS4, PS3, 360, XB1, and PC. Within
        the same timeframe was a listing of a ''''Resident Evil 2 HD'''' being briefly
        shown up on Amazon.com for a release date of September 29th, 2015. Capcom
        offered no such comment to the listing.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\"

        of Capcom''s R&amp;D division took to Facebook to inquire interest about an
        RE2 remake and what ''''the brand is all about'''', while also expressing
        concern with the fan-remake that was in development, titled ''''Resident Evil
        2 Reborn''''. Another developer calling himself ''''H'''' then took to Facebook,
        providing an update about how his bosses perceive the idea of an RE2 remake.<\/p><p>On
        July 31st, ''''H'''' posts again, now showing off the logo for an official
        Biohazard 2 (Japanese title for Resident Evil) remake document and how he
        was planning on bringing it to his higher ups. Finally, on August 12th, 2015,

        data-ref-id=\"3040-101308\">Yoshiaki Hirabayashi <\/a>and officially confirmed

        Kamiya<\/a>, was asked in an interview about wanting to work on an RE2 remake,
        he said no. He further explained that he prefers working on action games and
        doesn''t actually enjoy horror, that he gets scared too easily.<\/p><h3>Fan
        remake<\/h3><p>Before Capcom began officially acknowledging the possibility
        of remaking Resident Evil 2, an Italian development team called Invader Games
        started work in 2011 on their unofficial Resident Evil 2 remake, called Resident
        Evil 2 Reborn. It was built from the ground up in Unreal Engine 4 (originally
        Unity), with assets taken from other official Resident Evil games, such as
        <a href=\"\/resident-evil-the-darkside-chronicles\/3030-25558\" data-ref-id=\"3030-25558\">Darkside
        Chronicles<\/a> in particular, with many sound effects being ported from the
        original Resident Evil 2. The gameplay was primarily shown utilising the over-the-shoulder
        perspective of Resident Evil 4, though there existed a classic fixed camera
        angle alternative. The remake was to be completely free and was to release
        in August, 2015.<\/p><p>On August 17th, the fan remake was officially cancelled.
        However Capcom simultaneously cancelled the project while still also inviting
        Invader Games to speak with them to ''''further development''''. In response,
        Invader Games made a Facebook post:<\/p><blockquote><p>Hello everybody!<\/p><p>First
        of all we want to thank all of you for the passion and the attachment that
        you have daily shown us. We''ll be always grateful.<\/p><p>Today we want to
        join us of a very special day for InvaderGames. After the official announcement
        of the Resident Evil 2 remake by Capcom, we officialise the end of the works
        on Resident Evil 2 Reborn.<\/p><p>Contrary to what might be thought, this
        is wonderful news for us and, as fans, we''re so happy that Capcom has decided
        to take the lead of the project and to develop the remake awaited for years
        by everybody (nobody could bring back to life the masterpiece of 1998 better
        than the creators themselves). Meanwhile as developers, we''re honoured to
        announce that we''ve been officially invited to meet Capcom.<\/p><p>Capcom
        called us up in advance of the announcement and asked us if we would mind
        stopping the project as they had longer term plans for a Resident Evil 2 Remake.
        They have invited us to a meeting to discuss further ideas.<\/p><p>Even though
        we cannot complete the project of Resident Evil 2 Reborn, we''re happy that
        what we''ve shown has achieved consents from worldwide fans and especially
        has been noticed from Capcom itself. We promise that the work done until now
        will be useful for future projects, we won''t disappoint your and our expectations.<\/p><p>Thank
        you again for letting us to be where we are now in spite of the long way that
        remains to be walked through, we hope to focus soon on the biggest professional
        chance that we could get. Once more, we''re very grateful to Capcom for having
        noticed our work and having appreciated as much the love we feel about the
        Resident Evil saga as developing videogames. It''s very rare to find such
        a leader company in the industry so much open minded and sensitive to the
        work of a growing studio like ours, guided by passion and competence.<\/p><p>News
        available soon, stay tuned!<\/p><p>InvaderGames Team<\/p><\/blockquote>","expected_release_day":null,"expected_release_month":null,"expected_release_quarter":null,"expected_release_year":null,"id":50601,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/1\/10354\/2770147-2770141-re2.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/10354\/2770147-2770141-re2.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/1\/10354\/2770147-2770141-re2.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/10354\/2770147-2770141-re2.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/1\/10354\/2770147-2770141-re2.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/1\/10354\/2770147-2770141-re2.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/1\/10354\/2770147-2770141-re2.jpg"},"name":"Resident

        Evil: Survivor 2 - Code Veronica is the second game in the Gun Survivor series.
        Although the game has no bearing on the actual Resident Evil plot, it features
        characters and enemies that were in Code Veronica and also features the <a

        data-ref-id=\"3005-4453\">Steve Burnside<\/a> (A main character in Code Veronica)
        with a two play cooperative mode available in players choose to play together.
        The gameplay is slightly different than the original Gun Survivor game in
        the fact that it plays more like a traditional first person shooter rather
        than having a manual crosshair.<\/p><p>The game runs on a timer in which the
        players must advance through the levels however, if the timer counts down
        to zero, Nemesis will appear and easily dispose of the player unless an exit
        is reached quickly. There are two unlockable characters in Chris Redfield
        and <a href=\"\/rodrigo-juan-raval\/3005-20160\" data-ref-id=\"3005-20160\">Rodrigo
        Juan Raval<\/a>, in which the player must reach level 6 in Dungeon Mode on

        Gun Survivor 2 does follow Claire''s journey in her attempt to find her brother

        him so therefore it is not identical to Code Veronica.<\/p>","expected_release_day":null,"expected_release_month":null,"expected_release_quarter":null,"expected_release_year":null,"id":12811,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/8\/87790\/2331139-box_res2cv.png","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/87790\/2331139-box_res2cv.png","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/8\/87790\/2331139-box_res2cv.png","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/87790\/2331139-box_res2cv.png","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/8\/87790\/2331139-box_res2cv.png","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/8\/87790\/2331139-box_res2cv.png","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/8\/87790\/2331139-box_res2cv.png"},"name":"Resident

        the PS2, Xbox, GameCube, and PC. Despite this however, a sequel for the game

        the fallout of the attack, Jade receives two messages. The first is from a
        biologist asking her to take photographs of every unique species of life on
        the planet for financial reward (Jade uses this money to restore the functionality
        of the shield). The second message comes from a mysterious gentleman who tasks
        Jade with photographing a pair of alien monsters in the Black Isle Mines to
        prove that DomZ have already settled on the planet Hillys. The adventure,
        as Jade comes to find out, was a test by the IRIS network, a group of agents
        who suspect that the Alpha Sections are behind many of the DomZ kidnappings.
        Asking her to sneak into government facilities to photograph any evidence
        of malfeasance, Jade is soon roped into a conspiracy that will send her all
        over Hillys, and even to the dark side of the moon.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>Beyond
        Good &amp; Evil combines aspects of a number of game genres for various styles
        of play. These include sneaking, fighting, racing, photo-snapping, and shooting.<\/p><p>Jade
        spends the majority of the game sneaking around the various Alpha Section
        facilities, avoiding the heavily armed Alpha Sections guards. She can press
        herself up against walls, crawl through gaps, and roll to quickly avoid being
        detected. If needed, Jade can \"quietly\" take out the armed Alpha Sections
        soldiers by sneaking behind them and kicking their large air tanks. One hit
        to the tanks will cause green smoke to rupture from their helmets. As the
        soldier begins to run around and restore the proper air pressure, a second
        hit will cause the soldier''s gas tank to burst, rocketing them to the sky
        before they explode.<\/p><p>In the game''s boss fights (as well as any other
        battles) Jade will pull out her \"Dai-Jo\" staff to battle with the enemies.
        Jade doesn''t lock onto enemies, but can very easily switch the target of
        her attacks by pointing the analog stick towards a different opponent. Actual
        battle, often compared to combat in the 3-D Legend of Zelda games, has Jade
        dodging around attacks and attacking enemies when an opening appears. There
        are also other items that Jade can use in and out of combat that are collected
        throughout the game such as the disc shooter.<\/p><p>Jade often enters combat
        alongside Pey''j and Double H. These A.I controlled companions will help Jade
        find openings against targets.<\/p><p>The key goal of Jade''s missions are
        taking pictures of any suspicious activity inside the Alpha Section bases
        and exposing the conspiracy.<\/p><p>Since Jade is a photographer, much of
        the game takes place behind a camera lens. Like the <a href=\"\/nintendo-64\/3045-43\"
        data-ref-id=\"3045-43\">N64<\/a> game <a href=\"..\/..\/pokemon-snap\/61-10024\/\"
        rel=\"nofollow\"><i>Pok\u00e9mon Snap<\/i><\/a> and the <a href=\"\/playstation-3\/3045-35\"
        data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">PS3<\/a> game <a href=\"..\/..\/afrika\/61-21236\/\"
        rel=\"nofollow\"><i>Afrika<\/i><\/a>, Jade can take pictures of various animals.
        Taking a picture of one of these animals results in financial reward which
        is used for purchase of new items.<\/p><p>Pearls are another form of currency
        found throughout the world. They can be obtained by defeating bosses, winning
        races and finding secret caves and sections of the city. Pearls are mainly
        used to upgrade Jade''s hovercraft, giving it new capabilities that open up
        new sections of the world.<\/p><p>The actual game world of Hillys is a large
        ocean (divided into several \u201cmaps\" by loading screens), filled with
        tiny islands and alcoves for Jade to explore via hovercraft for new upgrades
        and finding new species of animal to photograph. There is also the main city
        of Hillys which is often returned to for mission updates and item purchase.<\/p><p>Towards
        the end of the game, the hovercraft merges with a large spacecraft - the Beluga.
        This allows Jade to fly into space for the final mission of the game.<\/p><h2>Soundtrack<\/h2><figure

        Evil Edition includes several features that are unique to this version of
        the game.<\/p><h3>Avenger Kills<\/h3><p>When a player dies in combat, the
        monster that killed him\/her sometimes levels up and then enters the game
        of someone on that player''s friends list, whether that second player is currently
        online or not. In the second player''s game, this monster is labeled as the
        \"Bane\" of his\/her friend. If the player is able to avenge his\/her friend,
        they both get a share of the loot. If the Bane monster kills the second player,
        it levels up again and enters the game of a friend of the second player. This
        process can continue several times until the Bane monster simply becomes too
        powerful and \"retires.\"<\/p><h3>Apprentice Mode<\/h3><p>This new mode allows
        lower level players the ability to temporarily get a boost when playing with
        higher level friends.<\/p><h3>In-Game Mail<\/h3><p>Players can trade items
        between each other via an in-game mail system.<\/p><h3>Player Gifts<\/h3><p>When
        a legendary item drops, there is a chance that second legendary will drop
        with it but with the name of a friend attached to it. It is that players''
        duty to send the gift to his\/her friend. So, even though some friends may
        not be able to play at the same time, they all benefit from each other playing.<\/p><h3>Character
        Transfer<\/h3><p>Those who have played Diablo III on PlayStation 3 or Xbox
        360 are able to transfer their characters to Ultimate Evil Edition on any
        platform regardless of which one they originally played. For example, an Xbox
        360 player can transfer his\/her save to PlayStation 4.<\/p><h2>PlayStation

        minions, and developing notoriety in a quest of world domination.","description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><p><i>Evil
        Genius<\/i> revolves around planning and maintaining a secret underground
        base, training minions, managing henchmen, and committing acts of infamy around
        the globe. It plays like a mixture of a very basic real-time strategy game
        <em>(Ex: Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle Earth), <\/em>a simulation game
        <em>(Ex: Sim Theme Park), <\/em>and features very slight puzzle elements.
        The puzzle elements require the player to think about how to complete a task.
        The ultimate goal of the game is to research, construct, develop notoriety,
        and ultimitely deploy one of three possible super weapons and conquer the
        world.<\/p><p> <\/p><h2>Digital Distribution<\/h2><p>Evil Genius was re-released
        by <a href=\"\/good-old-games\/3015-2379\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2379\"> Good
        Old Games<\/a> for $9.99 (at normal non\/sales price) with compatability &amp;
        support for Windows XP, Vista, and 7 for both 32 and 64-bit. <\/p><p>It can
        also be purchased on <a href=\"\/steam\/3015-718\" data-ref-id=\"3015-718\">
        Steam<\/a> for $9.99 (normal non\/sales price). <\/p><h2>Gameplay <\/h2><p>Evil
        Genius plays similar to Sim Theme Park, featuring the god game viewpoint,
        but gives the players the ability to direct minions to complete things using
        timeclocks, henchmen, and their evil genius. The game starts by requiring
        the player to map out their base in order to protect him or her from danger.
        If the Evil Genius is ever killed by the Forces of Justice, the game ends.
        <\/p><p> <\/p><p>As the Evil Genius, the player is limited to giving orders
        and relying on a staff of minions to carry them out. The game features an
        alarm to raise the level of awareness. Also, the Evil Genius can set one task
        or item as important, forcing the AI to interact or complete it right away.
        <\/p><p>Tasks are given to the player through a simple objective list. To
        progress through the story, the player must complete these tasks, but the
        game will continually send foes to the island to keep the player preoccupied
        during longer tasks. Players can also send minions to other places through
        the world map. While there, minions can steal items, complete missions, steal
        money, and kidnap people who can later be interrogated, opening up specialized
        minions.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Funding is acquired by using the world map, marking
        locations, and sending minions to steal it. Doing so raises notoriety, opening
        up missions, and increasing the heat, or threat level, on your island. Raising
        notoriety is the only way to advance in the game. By raising notoriety, opening
        missions, and completing missions, you will be rewarded with more notoriety
        and complete tasks set forth in the mission manager. Another benefit of raising
        your notoriety, it will allow you a higher limit to the number of minions
        on your island. Lastly, on regular intervals an increase in notoriety will
        lead to recruitment of another henchmen into your orginization.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Henchmen
        are the evil version of super agents. They are given super moves, and three
        lives. These lives can only be taken away when a henchmen is killed by a super
        agent. Henchmen can also inspire your minions into a group and lead then to
        defeat enemies on the island.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Throughout the game the forces
        of good will arrive to steal items, damage your base, find proof of evildoing,
        and to infiltrate your base. Another type of hero, the super agent, arrives
        periodically to cause as much damage and chaos as possible. Several precautions
        can be made to thwart these events. The setting of traps can eliminite foes,
        cause them to become confused, lose their intelligence, prevent them from
        advancing, or outright kill them. Super agents can only be eliminated through
        missions which lead to performing specific tasks in order to drain eliminate
        their will. One way to alert your minions of someone on the island is with
        the use of a security system. <\/p><h2> <\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\"

        control room staffed by construction workers (in yellow), science minions
        (white and light blue), henchmen (blue), military minions (orange), social
        minions (red), and the evil genius (Shen Yu, yellow and black). <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Presentation<\/p><p>The
        visual style in <i>Evil Genius<\/i> is steeped in the gaudy colors and flamboyant
        fashions popular in the late 1960''s and 70''s, firmly establishing a campy,
        cartoony aesthetic in every aspect of its presentation. Cel-shaded characters
        are clothed in bright, showy colors and brought to life through a rich variety
        of whimsical animations as workers dutifully unpack boxes, valets ingratiate
        themselves to suspicious agents with a quick shoe-shine, enemy thieves elaborately
        tip-toe from place to place, and brain-washing machines literally suck brains
        out of people''s ears and roll them around in a soapy spin cycle. Minions
        sent out to lurk on the world map for nefarious purposes appear in the form
        of board game tokens which topple over when captured or killed, and the game''s
        interface is set in stainless steel and displayed with ticking analogue counters.<\/p><p>Characters
        in the game speak through nonsensical mumbles and groans reminiscent of Maxis''
        <i>The Sims<\/i> franchise, using basic tone of voice to communicate their
        fear, discomfort, anger, and suspicion. One exception is the unseen \"Number
        2\" who occasionally delivers spoken information about new goals or shouts
        warnings about intruders within the compound, all in an imperial British accent
        evocative of one of James Bond''s classic femme fatales.<\/p><p>Featuring
        A musical score heavily inspired by films like <em>Austin Powers<\/em> and
        <em>007<\/em>, <i>Evil Genius<\/i> presents a very light-hearted take on its
        subject matter.<\/p><h2>Characters<\/h2><p><i>Evil Genius<\/i> is a heavily
        character based game, and a lot of strategy comes from cultivating and maintaining
        the right balance of staff manning the base and working out on the world map.<\/p><h3>Evil
        Genius<\/h3><p>Players choose one of the following avatars upon starting the
        game. This avatar can be directly controlled in the base to prioritize tasks
        or inspire the work force, but the game will end if he or she is killed by
        the Force of Good.<\/p><ul><li>Maximillian -- a squat, broad-shouldered man
        bearing a monocle who enjoys a bonus to research tasks. He starts the game
        with Jubei, the samurai henchman at his command.<\/li><li>Alexis -- an elegant,
        statuesque woman who inspires greater loyalty in all her minions. She begins
        the game with Eli Barracuda, the gangster henchman by her side.<\/li><li>Shen
        Yu -- a mysterious and foreboding figure whose reputation intimidates enemy
        agents into leaving his island more quickly. His loyal apprentice is Lord
        Kane, the psychic henchman.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Henchmen<\/h3><p>Each Evil Genius
        starts with one henchman in their employ, but can select more, by completing
        their mission on the world map, as they become more notorious on the global
        stage. Henchmen can be directly controlled while on the island, employ special
        powers in combat, gather nearby minions into a mobile fighting force, and
        excel at missions conducted on the world map. They can be temporarily subdued
        by enemy characters in combat, but if killed by an enemy super agent, henchmen
        will lose one of their three lives. These lives are irreplaceable, and if
        a henchman is killed, they are gone for the remainder of the game.<\/p><h2>Minions<\/h2><p>Construction
        workers arrive on the island at a monetary cost set by the player. They are
        used to construct rooms and are your only initial minions in the game. Through
        training, the construction workers can develop in one of three fields, military,
        social, and science.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>All minions can move furniture, loot,
        bodybags, and other items, but later in the game the social minions will be
        put in charge of these tasks. Each specialty is in charge of certain tasks
        on your island. Social minions are tasked with putting out fires and running
        your casino and hotel. Military minions are in charge of security and island
        and base defense. Science minions are in charge of research and repairing
        items around your base. <\/p><p> <\/p><p>Lowly construction workers arrive
        on the Evil Island periodically looking for work, forming the backbone of
        the labor force by excavating rooms, shuttling around briefcases full of money,
        and unpacking equipment. They can carry pistols and engage in basic hand-to-hand
        combat, but are easily defeated by more advanced enemy agents. However, with
        access to the proper training facility and a mentor to show them the ropes,
        workers can advance into more specialized careers.<\/p><ul><li><b>Soldiers<\/b>
        -- the Evil Genius'' own private military force. Soldiers are best at laundering
        money while on the world map.<\/li><\/ul><ol><li><b>Guards<\/b> are trained
        in shooting rifles and have higher health than normal workers.<\/li><li><b>Mercenaries<\/b>

        excel at precision shooting from a distance.<\/li><li><b>Martial Artists<\/b>
        can take down even the toughest foes at close range.<\/li><\/ol><ul><li><ul><li><b>Researchers<\/b>
        -- the division responsible for uncovering new Acts of Infamy and developing
        new gadgets. Researchers are best at plotting new Acts of Infamy on the world

        devious schemes.<\/li><\/ol><ul><li><b>Public Relations --<\/b> minions responsible
        for maintaining a respectable front and misdirecting suspicious enemy agents.
        When assigned to the world map, PR minions reduce the amount of heat generated
        by other operations.<\/li><\/ul><ol><li><b>Valets<\/b> provide a screen of
        distraction and are the only minions capable of using fire extinguishers to
        put out a blaze.<\/li><li><b>Spin Doctors<\/b> bewilder investigators and
        convince them to discard their suspicions.<\/li><li><b>Playboys<\/b> and <b>Diplomats<\/b>
        whittle away at the do-gooders'' sense of morality through seduction and outright
        bribery.<\/li><\/ol><p>There are also two special classes of minions who appear
        under specific circumstances.<\/p><ul><li>Freaks -- enormous blue-skinned
        homunculi who wander randomly about the island, brutally attacking anyone
        outside the Evil Genius'' employ. They are extremely resilient in combat but
        do not respond to alarms or commands of any kind. Freaks are created by mutating
        a corpse in the science center''s biotank.<\/li><li>Bodyguards -- superior
        combatants who linger near the Evil Genius at all times and will gladly die
        for his or her protection. Bodyguards are rare and only appear as certain
        notoriety milestones are passed.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Super Agents<\/h3><p>Each
        of the world''s five government agencies has a unique and especially deadly
        special agent at its command. These elite characters can be temporarily disabled
        through the use of extreme force, but will only be truly defeated through
        elaborate investigation available late in the game.<\/p><ul><li>Mariana Mamba
        -- a stunning female agent who can seduce even the most loyal minion into
        betraying the Evil Organization.<\/li><li>Jet Chan -- a shirtless martial
        artist in the vein of Bruce Lee, his fatal melee attacks are capable of striking
        down dozens of armed minions<\/li><li>Katarina Frostonova -- a Russian saboteur
        who can turn invisible to infiltrate the player''s base and strike directly
        at vital equipment<\/li><li>Dirk Masters -- a giant muscular, bandana-wearing
        commando who wields massive machine guns in each hand<\/li><li>John Steele
        -- a suave tuxedo-wearing spy able to scramble the base''s security systems
        at random and fire his silenced pistol with lethal accuracy<\/li><\/ul><h2>Trivia<\/h2><p>
        <\/p><ul><li>In its initial release, <i>Evil Genius<\/i> received criticism
        for some stability problems and a poorly named \"Load Save\" option which
        left some gamers with the impression that they could load an existing autosave,
        but not create a new one manually. A patch was released which helped resolve
        miscellaneous crashes and retitled the option \"Load \/ Save.\"<\/li><li>Even
        after the official patch, gameplay bugs remained which prohibit players from
        properly researching certain advancements and cause Henchmen to interfere
        with missions on the global map when they should be tremendously helpful.
        Fans of the game have released an unofficial patch to resolve many of these
        lingering issues.<\/li><li>The custom trap system was specifically designed
        to preclude systems which could lock enemy agents into an infinite loop, but
        dedicated players nonetheless uncovered specific and extremely intricate exploits
        which allowed them to permanently snare dozens of foes. These \"ubertraps\"
        are nearly impossible to implement by accident, and break the game balance
        by generating an infinite stream of revenue while simultaneously ridding the
        Evil Island of all enemy interference.<\/li><li>Shortly after the release
        of <i>Evil Genius<\/i>, developer Elixir Studios closed down operations. The
        rights to the franchise were purchased by Rebellion Developments in March
        of 2006.<\/li><\/ul><h2>System Requirements (PC)<\/h2><h3>Minimum<\/h3><ul><li><strong>OS

        Evil Within plays somewhat similarly to Resident Evil 4<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Labelled
        as a ''pure'' survival horror game by Shinji Mikami, The Evil Within is designed
        to strike a certain balance between horror and action elements. It greatly
        incorporates many elements of Mikami''s previous work in Resident Evil 4 --
        most notably how it plays from a third-person, over-the-shoulder perspective.
        Though unlike Resident Evil 4 The Evil Within is more of a standard shooter.
        One notable distinction is that there are no button-prompt melee attacks,
        though the player still has access to a punch that can knock enemies away.
        The actual damage it deals is minimal, however the player can also come upon
        torches and axes, which''ll kill a regular enemy in one-hit, though they are
        also one-use only. While players can aim with the game''s zoomed-in over-the-shoulder
        perspective, they can alternatively fire freely by pressing R2\/RT (default
        PlayStation &amp; Xbox controls) without aiming with L2\/LT. Much like in
        Resident Evil 4, players can choose between slowly opening a door or kicking
        it open; when kicking it open, it''ll knock back any enemies that are on the
        other side.<\/p><p>Sebastian will soon have access to matches, which he can
        use to burn the bodies of downed Haunted creatures. This thusly allows the
        player to prematurely kill a Haunted after shooting it so it has fallen over,
        and even enemies that are lying in wait for a certain event to be triggered
        before getting up.<\/p><p>Unlike the survival horror games of old, The Evil
        Within is strictly linear and doesn''t ever offer up a large environment for
        the player to explore at their leisure akin to the Spencer Mansion. However
        ammunition at least is difficult to come by, and players can only carry a
        certain amount of ammo per weapon. There are a sparse few puzzles dotted around
        the game, however they are relatively simple.<\/p><p>In an attempt to disassociate
        survival horror games with ''clunky'', unintuitive controls, The Evil Within
        allows players to move and shoot at the same time, with full analogue control
        as opposed to <a href=\"\/tank-controls\/3015-4647\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4647\">tank
        controls<\/a>. As in other recent horror games like <a href=\"\/dead-space\/3025-1229\"
        data-ref-id=\"3025-1229\">Dead Space<\/a>, <a href=\"\/heads-up-display\/3015-180\"
        data-ref-id=\"3015-180\">HUD <\/a>elements are kept to a minimum in the interest
        of immersion. What few HUD elements there are can also be turned off in the
        options.<\/p><p>Quick Time Events will be encountered across the game, though
        they''re kept to a minimum and will primarily be required for turning valves
        and the like.<\/p><p>Throughout the game the player will encounter files they
        can read, which''ll help provide backstory related to the current happenings
        in the game.<\/p><h3>Difficulty Levels<\/h3><p>The Evil Within features four
        difficulty levels:<\/p><ul><li>Casual -- Auto-aim is turned on for this mode.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>Survival<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>Nightmare
        -- This difficulty level is unlocked upon completing the game.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>Akumu
        -- which translates to ''''Worst Dream'''' in Japanese. This difficulty level
        must also be unlocked upon completing the game first. What makes it particularly
        notable over the lesser difficulties is that the player will die from a single
        hit.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Stealth<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\"

        hiding around a corner from an enemy.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Beyond merely
        shooting enemies, the player also has access to stealth. However it is rather
        rudimentary and is primarily restricted to allowing the player to crouch-walk
        and then potentially nail a stealth kill on an unsuspecting enemy.<\/p><p>Players
        can at least throw bottles in an attempt to distract the creatures, and can
        also choose to hide inside closets and under beds. However the noise made
        from going inside or out of a hiding spot is louder than one may expect and
        can potentially attract nearby enemies to the player''s position.<\/p><p>For
        the Casual and Survival difficulty settings, the player can choose to turn
        on an indicator that''ll let the player know if they''re hidden and when the
        enemy is made aware of their position.<\/p><h3>Traps<\/h3><p>The player will
        encounter many traps throughout the game, to which they are dangerous for
        both the player and the monsters that are patrolling the area. As such, the
        player could potentially use them to their advantage in fighting off enemies.
        Alternatively, the player can disarm them (most commonly by holding down X\/A)
        to then collect parts they can use to build ammunition for the Agony Crossbow
        weapon.<\/p><p>The traps are as such:<\/p><ul><li><strong>Tripwire<\/strong>
        - They''re typically tied to a stack of dynamite, instigating an explosion
        should someone cross it. However they may also sometimes function as an alarm,
        alerting any enemies within the vicinity.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><strong>Bear
        Trap<\/strong> - The most basic of the traps, if walked upon the player (or
        an enemy) will be temporarily stuck, and the player must wiggle the left analogue
        stick to escape.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><strong>Proximity Trap<\/strong> - This
        one will begin to rapidly beep once the player is near, and after so long
        will explode. Though it will not beep should the player be crouch-walking.
        It will not respond to any enemies, but can still be shot by the player to
        create an explosion. To disarm it the player must tap X\/A at the right time
        when the arrow spins into the blue area; if it lands in the red it will explode,
        as it will should the arrow spin a whole 360 degrees.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><strong>Acid
        Trap<\/strong> - Later on in the game, acid traps are introduced. They function
        as two opposing tanks filled with acid, to which will continually spew out
        a puddle of it within its immediate area. It will not affect any enemies that
        walk past it.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Inventory<\/h3><p>Weapons and items are stored
        in a ring, and when opened will drastically slow down the process of time.
        From there the player can select an item to use, however they can also set
        an item onto each direction of the four-way d-pad for a more convenient method
        of switching between weapons and healing supplies.<\/p><h3>Health &amp; Healing<\/h3><p>There
        are two items the player can use to heal themselves -- syringes and medkits.
        Syringes will simply heal the player by a set amount, whereas a medkit will
        heal Sebastian fully while also slightly increasing his overall health. However
        upon using a medkit, this''ll make Sebastian delirious for a few seconds,
        disallowing him from defending himself in any way.<\/p><p>Should Sebastian''s
        health drop near the bottom, this''ll slow his overall movement and stops
        him from being able to sprint. If the player stays still for a short while,
        his health will regenerate up to a certain point -- enough that he''ll regain
        full mobility of movement.<\/p><h3>AI Partners<\/h3><figure data-align=\"left\"

        and Joseph.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>For the majority of the game Sebastian
        will be on his own, though on some few occasions he will be accompanied by
        a partner character. His detective partner Joseph Oda will be the most recurring
        partner character, and is usually brought in for the more action-oriented
        scenes of the game. Oda will have access to weapons of his own depending on
        the situation--he''ll firstly use his own military pistol, then an axe at
        a later event--and can kill enemies. Oda isn''t invincible, though he can
        withstand more punishment than the player. When standing next to him, the
        player can hold down the X\/A buttons (default PlayStation &amp; Xbox controls)
        down for a few seconds to heal Oda completely.<\/p><p>Junior detective Juli
        Kidman may also be at the players side on occasion, though unlike Oda she
        is completely invincible; Kidman is also still able to kill any nearby enemies.
        During one occasion late in the game, the player will have both Oda and Kidman
        at their side to provide backup, both of whom are invincible this time around.
        Marcelo Jimenez and\/or Leslie Withers on a few occasions will also tag along
        with Sebastian; they both have no means of attack, but also cannot die.<\/p><h3>Save

        typewriters necessary this time.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Throughout the
        game, the player will begin to hear Clair de lune by Claude Debussy, signalling
        that a Save Room is nearby. To enter the room the player will usually have
        to read the nearby journal of Sebastian''s, which''ll then crack the mirror
        allowing the player to enter. Sometimes the mirror will already be cracked,
        and the story itself will also sometimes force the player to return to the
        Save Room.<\/p><p>The Save Room itself is a ward of the Beacon Mental Hospital,
        currently being overseen by Nursa Tatiana. While there the player can of course
        save their progress, though further back is a metal chair the player can sit
        on to then upgrade their abilities with use of ''green gel'', the game''s
        currency. In the back is a series of lockers the player can unlock for some
        supplies, though they first require keys that can be found during the main
        game to unlock. The contents inside are random. Finally there is a map of
        Krimson City located in Tatiana''s office, however it is missing a majority
        of its pieces that must be collected by the player to fill it in.<\/p><p>The
        game progresses throughout 15 separate chapters, each of which will allow
        the player to save before moving onto the next.<\/p><h3>Upgrades<\/h3><p>Note:

        are much more aggressive and are capable of utilising a number of weapons.
        Headshots are what work best, though shooting their legs to make them fall
        the ground is also a valid strategy as it then opens them up to being doused
        in flame with a match -- killing them instantly, and potentially catching
        and also killing any nearby Haunted as well.<\/p><p>When not aware of the

        a set pattern, allowing players to potentially sneak up and commit an instant-kill

        Haunted will wear masks to provide minor protection against their face.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>There
        are a variety of Haunted the player will encounter throughout the game. The
        most basic forms will utilise such weapons as axes, kitchen knives, torches,
        shovels and so on, if they''re not simply unarmed. Shooting the Haunted''s
        hand holding their weapon will make them drop it. If unarmed they''ll typically
        try to grab Sebastian, requiring the player to wiggle the stick to escape
        their grasp. However if they have a weapon and get close enough they can potentially
        instigate an attack showing them attack Sebastian with their weapon that cannot
        be avoided.<\/p><p>Haunted will sometimes opt to throw their melee weapon
        at the player, and some will even arrive ready with molotov cocktails or dynamite.
        Though if the player can shoot the projectile while it''s in the Haunted''s
        hands it will explode, killing them -- however it may still do damage to the
        player if they''re within proximity. Some Haunted will be shown wearing a
        mask, which while not indestructible does make headshots less viable of a
        strategy. It also makes them immune to the effects of flash bolts.<\/p><p>Certain
        Haunted throughout the game will have access to firearms. Early on they are
        restricted to bolt-action sniper rifles, though later in the game they can
        be encountered using revolvers, assault rifles, or even an Agony Crossbow
        complete with explosive bolts. The ones equipped with assault rifles are also
        typically found wearing not only a mask but also body armor, making them much
        more resistant to damage than most.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\"

        player will often encounter Haunted that are, as the game declares them, ''''fatter'''',
        which can withstand significantly more damage than the regular variety. Another
        special type of Haunted is one that is completely invisible. The way to pick
        their location is by noting any obstacles they inadvertently push out of their
        way, or puddles that will mark their footsteps; they''ll also reveal themselves
        just before they attack. This type of Haunted is only encountered in Chapter
        5.<\/p><p>Later in the game during Chapters 12-14, there''ll be Haunted firemen
        still with their extinguisher on their back. Shooting it will make it explode,
        killing the fireman Haunted and potentially damaging any nearby Haunted as
        well.<\/p><h3>Mr. Unknown<\/h3><p>The most dangerous type of Haunted, made
        distinctive by wearing a hood and robe akin to main antagonist Ruvik. Once
        alerted to the player they will unleash a vicious scream and then vomit a
        stream of red blood. The stream will then manifest into a puddle of blood,
        where the claws of Laura will begin lunging out. The puddle will chase the
        player for a set time until eventually evaporating, and the only way to end
        it prematurely is by killing the Haunted that unleashed it. If it catches
        the player, it is a one-hit kill. Not only are their offensive properties
        as such extremely dangerous, but they also cannot be stealth killed. Headshots
        won''t work either, as where their head should be is but a black void.<\/p><h3>AlterEgo<\/h3><p>An
        enemy similar to the Haunted, only they cannot use any weapons and are much
        more resistant to damage. Their primary source of attack is try and bite at
        the player, requiring them to wiggle the stick to throw it off. They will
        otherwise simply punch the player, though will also sometimes bring forth
        a tentacle that sprouts out of their torso, giving them an increased range
        of attack. AlterEgos will sometimes be encountered already on the floor and
        will slowly crawl towards the player. While the instinct is to throw a match
        unto them, AlterEgos will typically leap up at the player and begin biting
        them before they can get close enough to throw the match.<\/p><p>While headshots
        are the most suitable strategy, they notably have two heads, requiring players
        to destroy both to kill it thataway.<\/p><h3>Sadist<\/h3><p>A tall, bulbous
        chainsaw-wielding maniac, Sadists are encountered sparingly and function as
        sub-bosses. They are rather fast and are able to keep up with Sebastian even
        as he''s sprinting; any attack from a Sadist will also kill the player instantly.
        They are rather strong as one may expect and can withstand much more damage
        than any Haunted.<\/p><p>One Sadist in Chapter 15 is encountered while wielding
        a rocket launcher as opposed to a chainsaw, though he will eventually revert
        to a chainsaw once he''s ran out of ammo for his rocket launcher.<\/p><h3>Trauma<\/h3><p>Another
        sub-boss enemy that is fought rather infrequently throughout the game. Like
        the Sadist it can withstand a great deal of damage, though it does at least
        have weak spot on its back. Traumas have two forms; their first, default form
        has their arms locked in shackles wrapped with chains -- which they can use
        as a long-ranged attack. After so much damage, however, they will break free
        from their shackles and become more aggressive, but will also lose their ability
        to sling a chain towards the player.<\/p><h2>Boss Battles<\/h2><h3>Laura Part

        first boss battle of the game set at the end of Chapter 5. Players will encounter
        Laura a little earlier before they enter the battle arena, however their only
        option will be to run away.<\/p><p>When reaching the boss arena, Laura must
        now be ''killed'' in order to move on. Fortunately the battle is conveniently
        set within a furnace and Laura happens to have an innate weakness to fire.
        Simply shooting her will still deal damage, however she has a knack for rapidly
        teleporting towards the player avoiding the bullets in the process. As such,
        utilising the number of fire-related tools nearby is vital.<\/p><p>The primary
        source of fire is the furnace itself, which the player can potentially lure
        Laura into and then pull the nearby lever, opening the grate and dropping
        her into the fire below. This can be performed two times, however once each
        lever has been used is it then made to be inoperable. There are a number of
        red barrels that will ignite and explode when shot which will deal damage
        to Laura, however they are removed for the Nightmare and Akumu difficulty
        settings. There are also a few torches located that players can wield and
        attack Laura with as well. As Laura will often burst out of one of the many
        corpses located throughout the area, it''s possible the player can catch her
        on fire by throwing a match on the corpse as she''s materialising.<\/p><figure

        pair of mentally-challenged twins that have undergone extensive growth in

        after he is unleashed by a Haunted. Wielding a large makeshift club, he will
        swing it about and can potentially cause great damage if his attacks hit.<\/p><p>The
        other twin, Neun, is much more aggressive than his sibling and his noted by
        the tight leather mask he wears around his face, covering his eyes. He is
        thusly blind and relies on sound to track Sebastian, though he is also more
        prone to charging throughout the area. Unlike his brother, however, Zeun has
        no melee weapon in hand.<\/p><p>It''s possible that Zehn can be killed first
        before facing Neun, however the tight corridors from where he is first encountered
        may make this tricky. Players can attempt to run away from Zehn, at least
        until arriving at a more open environment to do battle, but that will also
        force the player to fight against both twins simultaneously.<\/p><h3>Sentinel<\/h3><figure

        large, ravenous canine of sorts. The Sentinel boss fight is a simple one,
        as the player is forced into a circular battle ground and must unload whatever
        weaponry they have into the beast. However Sentinel is rather fast, which
        can make hitting it and also avoiding its rush attacks difficult. It will
        routinely hide within the bushes in the area, before then charging out untoward
        the player.<\/p><p>Once it has taken enough punishment the player is able
        to escape, however Joseph Oda then notes that the dog knocked off his glasses.
        The player must now head back into the arena and collect the glasses, just
        as Sentinel regains its strength. From this point on the player can choose
        to either collect the glasses and head back to Joseph, or attempt to kill
        Sentinel once and for all. To collect the requisite green gel reward from
        the boss fight Sentinel must be killed; simply beating it during the first
        bout will yield no rewards.<\/p><h3>The Keeper Part I<\/h3><p>A mysterious
        creature that is dressed like a butcher while also wearing a safe on its head.
        The first time the player encounters The Keeper they are to try and simultaneously
        turn the valves to halt the stream of poison gas, while also trying to stave
        off The Keeper.<\/p><p>While killing The Keeper isn''t especially difficult,
        it is able to materialise from any one of the safe heads littered throughout
        the area.<\/p><h2>Unlockables<\/h2><h3>Difficulty Settings<\/h3><p>Both Nightmare

        Assignment was the first piece of substantial DLC to be released, on March
        10th, 2015. With Juli Kidman as the protagonist, The Assignment differs greatly
        from the main game in that the player doesn''t have access to any guns. The
        player must instead rely upon stealth and generally staying out of combat
        to proceed. Puzzles also factor into the game more heavily than in the main
        game.<\/p><p>There is only the one difficulty available by default, though

        Sebastian, Kidman is able to take cover and from there can call out to potentially
        alert enemies. When leaving cover, she will have a slight burst in speed for
        roughly a second or so as to help her move from cover to cover. Vents and
        crawl spaces can be found throughout the environment, which will help the
        player to circumvent enemies and stay hidden.<\/p><p>Kidman''s primary piece
        of equipment is her flashlight, which she must use to help explore the area
        as the environments are typically rather dark. She can also use the flashlight
        to uncover secret rooms, by focussing the flashlight on any of the Mobius
        symbols. During one instance where she encounters invisible Haunted, she can
        use the flashlight to temporarily reveal them to the player''s view. Players
        will also encounter bottles, which can be used much like in the main game
        as a means to create a distraction to lure away enemies.<\/p><p>While most
        forms of combat have been completely removed, Kidman does still have access
        to a melee attack. However much like Sebastian''s it is only suitable for
        defence as the damage it deals is minimal; that, and a single kick will use
        up around half her stamina. There is at least one segment where Kidman is
        trapped and must shoot all of the encroaching enemies; she will have infinite
        ammo for her pistol during this time, however this is the only occasion during
        the DLC where she can actively use it.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\"

        and a woman attached by a chain''''. Because of the two-character setup, cooperative
        gameplay was to be a significant role in the game; when played solo, players
        would then have to control the two characters simultaneously -- similar to

        A Tale of Two Sons<\/a>. This idea was eventually scrapped, after Mikami had
        received feedback suggesting that vampires weren''t very popular, and that
        his colleagues wished to design a more traditional horror game instead. Other
        such stages of their first game included it having a sci-fi aesthetic, to
        also being open-world.<\/p><p>The Evil Within was eventually revealed with
        its now official title via an IGN-exclusive live-action teaser trailer, with
        further exclusive coverage on IGN the following week.<\/p><p>As the self-proclaimed
        ''father of survival horror'', Mikami took on this endeavor specifically because
        he believes there is a noticeable lack of survival horror games in the market.
        What often passes for survival horror is considered too action-focused by
        Mikami, and he hopes to bring back the balance of experiencing the fear of
        a horror game with the thrill of an action game to the sub-genre.<\/p><p>Mikami
        has stated that the Winchester Mystery House played a part in inspiring the
        look and design of some of the environments in the game. Martin Scorsese''s
        film interpretation of <em>The Shutter Island<\/em> story has also been cited
        as an inspiration during development, as was Christopher Nolan''s <em>Inception<\/em>
        film. The visual design of the Keeper creature was partly inspired by <a href=\"\/clive-barker\/3040-37997\"
        data-ref-id=\"3040-37997\">Clive Barker<\/a>''s <em>Hellraiser <\/em>film<em>.<\/em><\/p><p>On
        May 27th, The Evil Within''s release was delayed from August 26th to October
        21st for NA, the 23rd for Oceania, and 24th for Europe. On July 18th, however,
        the date was then pushed <em>forward <\/em>a week for a worldwide October
        14th release.<\/p><p>Amongst brainstorming for DLC, one such idea involved
        the player taking the role Joseph Oda as a ninja (whose family is descended
        from ninjas), to which the gameplay was said to resemble <a href=\"\/dishonored\/3030-35850\"
        data-ref-id=\"3030-35850\">Dishonored<\/a>. So much so that the title for
        the DLC was jokingly referred to as ''''Dis''Oda''d''''.<\/p><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/videos\/here-s-the-live-action-teaser-for-shinji-mikami-s-\/2300-7281\"

        the trailer<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The trailer that officially introduced
        the game was produced by the company Prologue Pictures and was directed by
        <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/kyle-cooper\/3040-64921\" data-ref-id=\"3040-64921\">Kyle
        Cooper<\/a>. It was made using only practical effects (such as prosthetics
        and makeup) rather than CGI. To add to the bloodied effect of some of the
        characters shown in the trailer, such as the multi-armed ''Reborn'' called
        Laura, the performers were to sit in a bath filled with fake blood for hours
        on end. The trailer took 3 days to complete.<\/p><p>Executive-producer Alex
        Dervin said that some actors suffered discomfort during filming, but this
        served to instil ''''some of the anger'''' necessary for the roles.<\/p><h3>The
        Onion Barbed Wire Trailer<\/h3><p>Bethesda teamed up with the satirist news
        website The Onion to produce a trailer, parodying the often brought up criticisms
        about how certain cultures\/minorities ect. are portrayed within games. It
        sets itself up as a news headline, vilifying Bethesda for their portrayal
        of barbed wire and how it is often shown as a tool for murder and\/or by murderers,
        subliminally referring to <a href=\"\/boxman\/3005-28555\" data-ref-id=\"3005-28555\">Boxman<\/a>.<\/p><h3>Japanese
        Title<\/h3><p>The game''s Japanese release is entitled \"PsychoBreak,\" a
        name chosen because it is much easier for native Japanese speakers to pronounce.
        This mirrors Resident Evil''s use of the title \"Biohazard\" in Japan. Much
        like most games, The Evil Within went through numerous other names before
        settling on its final moniker; ''''Mobius'''' was one such name.<\/p><h3>Censorship
        in Japan<\/h3><p>In order to get past scoring a rating of CERO Z for a more
        widespread CERO D, The Evil Within''s gore in its Japanese release will be
        <a href=\"\/censored-version\/3015-2170\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2170\">censored<\/a>.
        However by preordering the game, Japanese players will then have access to
        a free download to unlock the game''s gore.<\/p><p>Come the game''s release,
        however, it was uncovered that even with the gore turned on it''s still censored
        to a certain degree when compared to the game''s western releases.<\/p><h2>Alternate

        Axis of Evil is a top down, dual stick shooter that was developed by A.C.R.O.N.Y.M,
        and was released on Xbox Live on March 5th of 2008, and March 6th on PSN.
        The game is based around a treaty between The Legion of Terra and Mars, and
        the planets Mercury, Venus, and Earth, which form the Alliance of Free Planets.
        Though during the creation of this treaty, the leader of the gets kidnapped
        by the Axis of Evil, and you have to save him. During the story line, you
        travel to different planets and space stations around the galaxy, searching
        for the leader, and trying to save the day.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\"

        choose between three different races of creatures, Human, Mercurian, and Venusian,
        as well as allowing you to choose between three different classes of characters,
        Engineer, Warrior, and Outcast. The game allows you then though to create
        your character as you please, giving you numerous skin colors, and genders
        to choose from. Though following the creation of your character, the game
        follows a linear based gameplay. You continue on a set path from Planet to
        Planet, or sometimes to a Space Station, where you use the left thumb stick
        to move, and the right thumb stick to shoot.<\/p><p>Rocketmen: Axis of Evil
        also has some RPG elements thrown in, with the usual, gain experience through
        killing numerous enemies, and leveling up you abilities. Though one of the
        unique things about Rocketmen is the way your weapons function. Instead of
        using a set number of bullets for each gun, you have a certain time limit
        that you are able to use it for. Once the time has run out, you have to pick
        up another weapon. The game also has a different variation of some usual guns;
        including pistol, shotgun, and then some other guns with a sci-fi twist added.
        For example, the, \u2018Razor,\u2019 is the usual machine gun, but instead
        of firing bullets, it fires saw blades, that will reflect off of the walls,
        or the Vulcan that will fire two sets of bullets, instead of one. You also
        have some other weapons at your disposal including rockets and mines. The
        game also supports two to four player co-op, that is both online, and offline
        enabled.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3470\/636744-rocketmen2.jpg\"

        Originally conceived as a trilogy of games, development of the sequel was
        shelved for years after the original game failed to sell as well as anticipated
        by its publisher, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-82\" href=\"\/ubisoft-entertainment\/3010-82\">Ubisoft<\/a>.
        This new entry in the trilogy will be developed by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-3911\"

        Ancel<\/a>. The game was announced at Ubidays 2008 on May 29, 2008. According
        to Ancel, the game was still in the pre-production stage at the time of the
        announcement. It has been said that the difficulty of the game will go down
        a notch because Yves Guillemot, CEO of Ubisoft, doesn''t want to repeat the
        disastrous sales of the first title.<\/p><p>Since the initial announcement
        and release of a reveal trailer in 2008, Ubisoft has shown nothing of the
        game publicly. Three years after the initial announcement on June 7th, 2011,
        Ancel made a claim on GameTrailers TV that the publisher is waiting for the
        next generation of consoles for \"the power needed to deliver the experience
        he wants from the game\". He would not comment on whether or not the recently
        announced <a data-ref-id=\"3045-139\" href=\"\/wii-u\/3045-139\">Nintendo

        Medium<\/p><p>Range: Low<\/p><p><em>Bow and Arrow<\/em> -- Standard bow and
        arrow used by Turok. The longer the player holds the trigger the further the
        arrow will travel and the more damage it will do.<\/p><p>Damage: Low<\/p><p>Range:

        faster, has a higher damage output, has a sniper scope for more accurate arrow
        placement, and can fire Tek Arrows that explode on impact.<\/p><p>Damage:

        Causes no damage to anything. Unlimited charges, but must recharge between
        each shot. A very impressive feat of locational lighting for its time.<\/p><p>Damage:

        Launcher<\/em> -- Only usable underwater, this fires powerful exploding torpedoes

        on it that allows Turok to swim much faster while it is selected.<\/p><p>Damage:

        an enemy will put them to sleep for a short time and works on almost any enemy.
        However, if the enemy wakes up it will harbour a serious grudge.<\/p><p>Damage:
        NA<\/p><p>Range: Long<\/p><p><em>Charge Dart Rifle<\/em> -- An upgraded version

        Bore<\/em> -- One of the most famous weapons in all of gaming, this delightful
        little gadget will lock on to the brain activity of an enemy and fire a small
        orb which attaches to an enemy''s head, drills into their skull, and sucks
        out their brain in the form of a gooey liquid, before exploding violently
        and decapitating them for good measure. The major drawbacks are that it cannot
        fire until it achieves a lock on an enemy''s brain patterns, which is difficult
        with fast-moving enemies, and can only happen at relatively close range. In
        addition, the Bore is useless against enemies wearing protective headgear,
        or non-sentient enemies whose brain activity is not powerful enough to achieve
        a lock.<\/p><p>Damage: One shot, one kill<\/p><p>Range: Long<\/p><p><em>Shotgun<\/em>

        the shotgun. Not only will this double the damage output but also the shells
        will have the ability to ricochet off of walls.<\/p><p>Damage: Very High<\/p><p>Range:

        <a href=\"\/glaive\/3055-927\" data-ref-id=\"3055-927\">glaive<\/a> that flies
        through the air, severing arms, legs, and heads as it goes, and then returns
        to Turok''s hand, slick with gore.<\/p><p>Damage: High<\/p><p>Range: Long<\/p><p><em>Grenade

        High<\/p><p>Range: Low<\/p><p><em>Firestorm Cannon<\/em> -- Essentially this
        weapon is a high powered minigun that fires exploding energy bullets. Exactly
        as satisfying as it sounds. Takes a second to warm up as you begin firing.<\/p><p>Damage:
        High<\/p><p>Range: Medium<\/p><p><em>Flamethrower<\/em> -- This will set enemies
        on fire for a high damage output.<\/p><p>Damage: High<\/p><p>Range: Low<\/p><p><em>Sunfire
        Pods<\/em> -- Odd natural growths found only in the Lost Lands, Sunfire Pods
        release a quick burst of incredibly bright light when broken. Turok throws
        them like grenades in order to temporarily blind his enemies. The Blind Ones
        in particular, who evolved in eternal blackness, are so sensitive to light
        that the light burst will cause their heads to burst into flames, killing
        them instantly.<\/p><p>Damage: None or Lethal, depending on target<\/p><p>Range:
        Medium<\/p><p><em>Proximity Fragramation Mine (PFM) Layer<\/em> -- This device
        will lay proximity mines along the ground. When an enemies get close enough,
        the mines will jump into the air to knee-height and explode, severing unlucky
        enemies'' legs and leaving them to quickly bleed to death in horrific agony.<\/p><p>Damage:
        High<\/p><p>Range: Low<\/p><p><em>Scorpion Missile Launcher<\/em> -- Will
        lock on to a single enemy and then fire a barrage of missiles. Almost nothing
        can survive even one barrage.<\/p><p>Damage: Very High<\/p><p>Range: Long<\/p><p><em>The
        Nuke<\/em> -- Judged by the Lazarus Concordence to be too powerful to allow
        <i>anyone<\/i> to use, this portable Weapon of Mass Destruction was broken
        into pieces, which were then scattered across the Lost Land, and Turok must
        find each and every piece in order to use it. The Nuke takes a very long time
        to charge up before firing, and ammo is very rare, but when it finally goes
        off, <i>watch out<\/i>. It fires a bullet into whatever it''s pointed at that
        triggers an enormous energy burst which instantly incinerates every single
        enemy in the area, leaving behind crispy statues of ash in the shape of the
        enemies, yet is handily harmless to Turok.<\/p><p>Damage: Utterly Lethal<\/p><p>Range:

        developed by Animation Magic Inc. and published by Phillips, Link: The Faces
        of Evil is considered to be one of the all-time worst video games.","description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><p>Released
        for the <a data-ref-id=\"3010-48\" href=\"\/philips-interactive-media-inc\/3010-48\">Philips<\/a>
        <a data-ref-id=\"3045-27\" href=\"\/cd-i\/3045-27\">CD-i<\/a> system in 1993,
        <i>Link: The Faces of Evil<\/i> was a departure from what had made the other
        <a data-ref-id=\"3025-9\" href=\"\/the-legend-of-zelda\/3025-9\"><i>Zelda<\/i>
        games<\/a> a success. Complaints range from the cheesy plot to the awkward,
        difficult controls. While some elements of game play from <a data-ref-id=\"3030-16241\"
        href=\"\/zelda-ii-the-adventure-of-link\/3030-16241\"><i>Zelda II: Link''s
        Adventure<\/i><\/a> are present (most notably the side scrolling mechanic),
        the game was unanimously panned by critics at the time. As <a data-ref-id=\"3010-90\"
        href=\"\/nintendo\/3010-90\">Nintendo<\/a> had no role in the actual creation
        of the game, Nintendo does not acknowledge the events or characters within
        it to be official canon of the series.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p><i>Link: The
        Faces of Evil<\/i> plays like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-16241\" href=\"\/zelda-ii-the-adventure-of-link\/3030-16241\">Zelda
        2: Link''s Adventure<\/a>, but not as smooth because of the way the CD-i controller
        behaved. Like in <i>Zelda II<\/i>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-191\" href=\"\/link\/3005-191\">Link<\/a>
        visits towns and places doing stuff to get items that can help him on his
        quest to save <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10799\" href=\"\/king-harkinian\/3005-10799\">the
        King<\/a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-5\" href=\"\/zelda\/3005-5\">Zelda<\/a>
        as well. Controlling Link in <i>The Faces of Evil<\/i> can be an exercise
        in frustration requiring a lot of patience, as it is nearly impossible to
        get Link to do what you want him to do and the fact that enemies pop up every
        time their spawn points move off-screen doesn''t help.<\/p><p>It''s not at
        all that bad once you get the controls down, but after playing it for so long
        you''ll get tired of having to do the endless <a data-ref-id=\"3015-265\"
        href=\"\/fetch-quests\/3015-265\">fetch quests<\/a>. But at least unlike in
        <i>Zelda II<\/i> there are no <a data-ref-id=\"3015-848\" href=\"\/pit\/3015-848\">pits<\/a>
        in which you <a data-ref-id=\"3015-740\" href=\"\/instant-death\/3015-740\">die
        instantly<\/a>, you can only be killed by the enemies in the game.<\/p><h2>Plot<\/h2><p>The
        plot in Link The Faces of Evil is pretty simple and straightforward.<\/p><p>It
        starts one day in <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1765\" href=\"\/hyrule-castle\/3035-1765\">Hyrule
        Castle<\/a> with Link complaining about how boring it is there and the King
        tells him \"This peace is what all true warriors strive for.\"<\/p><p>As Link
        tells him he wonders what <a data-ref-id=\"3005-512\" href=\"\/ganon\/3005-512\">Ganon<\/a>
        is up to, an old man suddenly arrives on a flying carpet and tells the King
        the Island of Kordia is under attack from Ganon. Why exactly the King of Hyrule
        should care is unknown.<\/p><p>The man, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-12165\" href=\"\/gwonam\/3005-12165\">Gwonam<\/a>,
        shows the King and Link a piece of <a data-ref-id=\"3055-865\" href=\"\/paper\/3055-865\">paper<\/a>
        saying that only Link can defeat Ganon. This excites Link, who has nothing
        better to do, and he says he''ll go to grab his stuff, but Gwonam ignorantly
        tells him his sword is enough. Before Link goes off he asks Zelda for a kiss
        for luck, but is turned down by her, telling Link he must be kidding. Link
        sets off to stop Ganon and liberate Kordia.<\/p><p>In his adventures in Kordia,
        Link meets a colourful cast of characters, including a fat shopkeeper named
        <a data-ref-id=\"3005-8902\" href=\"\/morshu\/3005-8902\">Morshu<\/a> who
        will sell Link lamp oil, ropes, and bombs as long as he has enough rupees,
        a pig that turns people into animal slaves, a weird fat woman who wants Link
        to find something for her, and a guy in a metal suit who hardens people into
        robots with fire(?)<\/p><p>Finally after all is said and done Link finally
        faces Ganon in a duel in which Ganon offers Link to join him or he will kill
        him. Link refuses and throws a book at Ganon and seals him in it, rendering
        Ganon the easiest boss fight in the game, and after that he rescues Zelda,
        who was not known to be missing previously. Gwonam tells Link he did a good
        job. Link tells Zelda that''s worth a kiss, but Zelda just laughs and the
        game ends.<\/p><h2>Development<\/h2><p>Being the first licensed games for
        the CD-i, Phillips took advantage of what they had and gave the game a low
        budget of 600,000 dollars for the game and a little over a year to create
        this and Wand of Gamelon. The team that created the game consisted of four
        artists, three programmers and one musician. The <a data-ref-id=\"3015-604\"
        href=\"\/full-motion-video\/3015-604\">FMVs<\/a> in the game were created
        by a team of Russians animators that were flown in to help on the project
        as well. Even Link''s catch phrase from the Zelda cartoon was thrown in as
        well.<\/p><h2>Reception<\/h2><p><i>Link: The Faces of Evil<\/i> was panned
        as one of the worst <i>Zelda<\/i> games ever made (matched only by fellow
        crappy CD-i games <i><a data-ref-id=\"3030-14181\" href=\"\/zeldas-adventure\/3030-14181\">Zelda''s
        Adventure<\/a><\/i> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-17713\" href=\"\/zelda-the-wand-of-gamelon\/3030-17713\"><i>Zelda:
        The Wand of Gamelon<\/i><\/a>) because of the controls and the gameplay and
        the basic cheesiness of the game itself and the voice acting, which is considered
        to be some of the worst in gaming. What also made the game bad was the fact
        that the enemies in the game were cheap and sometimes you would die for no
        reason, but despite all the negatives of the game some misguided idiots praised
        it because of the artwork, and the FMVs were technically good for their time.
        But the music was considered low-average compared to the main games. A lot
        of websites have listed the CD-i <i>Zelda<\/i> games in their lists as some
        of the worst videogames ever as well.<\/p><h2>Trivia<\/h2><ul><li>The ridiculous
        FMV cutscenes from the Zelda CD-i games are popular today because of the \"
        <a href=\"http:\/\/youtube.wikia.com\/wiki\/YouTube_Poop\" rel=\"nofollow\">Youtube
        Poop<\/a>\" concept.<\/li><li>Despite being some of the worst games ever made,

        enhanced damage and invulnerability, and are gained by defeating bosses throughout

        <\/a>and Charles. But then Zippo finds a letter that is addressed to Tomba.
        The letter states that Tabby, Tomba''s childhood friend, has disappeared.
        Fearing for her safety, Tomba jumps into the ocean, embarking on a journey
        to go and rescue her. Tomba and Zippo wind up in the fisherman village. There
        they meet an old man by the name of Kainen who points them in the direction
        of the Coal-mining town, Tabby''s hometown. When they reach the Coal-mining
        town they meet up with a man by the name of Gran, an old friend of Zippo''s.
        He then points Tomba in the direction of Tabby''s house but when they get
        there they see that Tabby is not there. Gran later says that he saw Tabby
        on her way to the Kujara Ranch by trolley. He also mentions that the trolley
        is on its way back and that Tabby would be on it. But when the trolley comes
        back, its empty leaving Tomba, Zippo, and Gran confused. However, a panicking
        trolley worker runs through and reveals that Tabby has been kidnapped by the
        evil pigs. Gran explains that evil pigs are evil beings that have cursed the
        continent. Tomba is determined to go after the evil pigs and save tabby. Before
        Tomba goes on his quest, Gran gives Tomba an evil pig bag for the flame pig.
        The bag, according to Gran, could capture an evil pig and put and end to the
        curse on the continent.<\/p><p>Tomba would go on and collect the rest of the
        evil pig bags, one for each cursed town. He cured the coal mining town of
        its intense fire around the town. He also cured the Kujara Ranch of perpetual
        snow fall, the Donglin Forest from the haunting of the ghost pig, lifts the
        curse on the circus town which has turned all of its citizens into pigs, and
        he cures the Water Temple from perpetual rainfall. Once all the evil pigs
        have been captured, the leader of the evil pigs reveals himself to Tomba.
        He tells Tomba to find his lair if he wishes to stop him. Tomba and Zippo
        not only find his lair, but they also find Kainen their waiting for them.
        He gives Tomba an evil pig bag to use on the final evil pig to capture him.
        He also warns Tomba that the last evil pig will try to freeze time in an attempt
        to stop Tomba. However, Kainen tells him he knows a spell that will allow
        Tomba to resist the stoppage of time. Sure enough, the evil pig does freeze
        time but with the help of Kainen''s spell, Tomba enters the evil pig''s lair
        and face him. Tomba fights the final battle and is able to capture the last
        evil pig. However, the last evil pig warns Tomba that he would be back and
        that next time, he might not be so lucky.<\/p><p>Tomba and Zippo find Tabby
        in the evil pig''s lair. With the area around them collapsing, Tomba, Tabby,
        and Zippo are able to escape on top of Tomba''s flying dog, Baron. They all
        go back to Tabby''s house where she has prepared a feast in celebration of
        Tomba''s victory. After the feast, Kainen appears and gives Tomba a monkey
        suit for completing every quest in the game. Tomba then is given a new boat
        in order to go back to his home. However, Tomba crashes the boat on the way
        home causing everyone to laugh.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\"

        data-ref-id=\"3005-9561\">Tomba<\/a> moves on predetermined linear paths until
        he reaches an intersection point where a flashing arrow appears over his head.
        At that point, Tomba can move in either direction the arrow points. Town areas

        data-ref-id=\"3015-788\">top-down<\/a> view, allowing Tomba to move around
        freely.<\/p><p>Tomba! 2 is mainly an adventure game with some platforming
        bits thrown in. The game that is the most analogous to Tomba! 2 is the <a
        href=\"\/the-legend-of-zelda\/3025-9\" data-ref-id=\"3025-9\">Legend of Zelda<\/a>.
        The game gives you a main story quest to go out and capture five evil pigs.
        These evil pigs all have different elemental affinities including fire, earth,
        water, ice, and ghost. These pigs are captured through the use of pig bags
        which not only capture the evil pigs, it also reveals the evil pigs'' hiding
        spot. The game is actually so similar to the Legend of Zelda that the game
        has a final quest where it makes you backtrack through all the different towns
        to unlock the final boss. The game also has 137 side quests which makes this
        one of the longer games out their. Each quest usually involves solving a problem
        for somebody whether its collecting a bunch of crabs for somebody or helping
        out with an ancient ritual.<\/p><p>The game doesn''t have a whole lot of combat
        but it does utilize combat some parts. The game is chock full of weapons such
        as a mace on a chain, a boomerang, a hammer, etc. The weapons don''t actually
        kill enemies but it does stun them so you can eliminate them. To actually
        kill enemies, you must jump on top of them where Tomba will grab the enemy.
        Then you must hit the jump button twice where Tomba will throw the enemy and
        kill the enemy once and for all.<\/p><h2>Unlocks<\/h2><p>As the game progresses,
        Tomba can obtain special suits and weapons that give him new abilities and
        access to area previously unobtainable.<\/p><p>For example, the flying squirrel
        suit allows Tomba to glide long distances while the pig suit allows Tomba
        to communicate with friendly pigs.<\/p><h3>Weapons<\/h3><p>Tomba acquires
        many weapons during the course of the game, including:<\/p><ul><li>The Blackjack

        <\/h2><p>Tomba! 2 received generally positive reviews from critics.The game
        holds an 82 percent rating on gamerankings. However, even though the game
        and its prequel were critically well-received, the games sales were poor.
        As a result of the poor sales, developer Whoopee Camp had to shut down which
        meant that franchise would die off. <\/p>","expected_release_day":null,"expected_release_month":null,"expected_release_quarter":null,"expected_release_year":null,"id":2723,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/8\/87790\/2126457-box_tomba2.png","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/87790\/2126457-box_tomba2.png","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/8\/87790\/2126457-box_tomba2.png","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/87790\/2126457-box_tomba2.png","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/8\/87790\/2126457-box_tomba2.png","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/8\/87790\/2126457-box_tomba2.png","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/8\/87790\/2126457-box_tomba2.png"},"name":"Tomba!

        a third-person computer RPG that focuses on tactical combat, stealth and exploration.
        It is the third game in the Allods series, after Rage of Mages 1 & 2.","description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><p>Players
        control Zak, an amnesiac who wakes up on the island of Gipath and is quickly
        dubbed the Chosen One by the local villagers, mostly as a way of tricking
        him into solving their problems for them. He must discover his lost memories
        as well as helping various NPCs and factions to progress further across the
        island. As the game continues, Zak is able to explore other lands beyond Gipath.<\/p><p>He
        can be accompanied by up to two followers who are controlled by the player
        as well. The player must manage their tactics in battle separately, even sending
        them off to perform independent tasks, in much the same way as the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-495\"
        href=\"\/infinity-engine\/3015-495\" slug=\"infinity-engine\">Infinity Engine<\/a>
        games.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>Each character has a health bar, with death
        occurring should the bar ever empty. They also have a stamina bar, which goes
        down whenever the character runs or uses magic. If the character stands still,
        the stamina bar will quickly fill up. Therefore, healing back to full in non-combat
        situations is relatively easy, though stamina is a constant concern mid-battle
        as it does not refill if the character is in combat.<\/p><p>Most of the game''s
        action takes place in \"game-zones\", which are 3D landscape \"maps\" that
        the player explores to fulfill quests he is given by various NPCs. Usually,
        exploring beyond quest areas means encountering enemies and situations beyond
        one''s current ability, though a stealthy character might find a way around.
        Enemies do not respawn once killed in an area, so it''s often in the player''s
        best interest to \"genocide\" the level-appropriate creatures in any given
        area for maximum XP gain and item drops.<\/p><p>There are many situations
        where the player cannot blindly charge into a fight and must use the stealth
        system. Characters have four modes of mobility: Run (which is quick but uses
        stamina), Walk (default), Crouch (slow, but harder to spot), Crawl (slowest,
        but hardest to spot). A few special enemies are designed to be far too powerful
        to fight and need to be snuck by.<\/p><p>The game has a diverse crafting system,
        which allows the player to take apart weapons and armor Zak finds and reconstruct
        them with stronger materials and magic. Materials can be readily found on
        most enemies (as well as regular vendor trash with no other purpose than to
        sell). However, crafting is only available in stores, and the player''s inventory
        and level-up screens are only accessible in stores and on the world map between
        areas. Players must make sure they have all the right equipment on before
        entering a game-zone.<\/p><p>Characters level up based on XP they are constantly
        accruing. Half of this XP is automatically transferred into bonus HP and Magic,
        and thus isn''t accessible to the player. The other half can be assigned to
        six classes: Melee (close combat), Archery (ranged combat), Use\/Steal (the
        ability to use items and steal from enemies when in-stealth), Elemental Magic
        (mostly attack, some buffs), Astral Magic (healing, buffs and debuffs) and
        Sensory Magic (mostly buffs concerning scouting\/divination). Characters can
        also choose specializations in weapons and magic, as well as stat boosts,
        faster stamina or health regeneration, encumbrance (which decides how much
        heavy armor the character can wear), nightvision and more. As a character
        picks up more specializations, remaining ones become more expensive to \"buy\"
        with XP, forcing the player to be selective when choosing the most appropriate
        skills for that character.<\/p><p>Though the player is able to level-up and
        equip companions, Zak must abandon them each time he leaves an island for
        the next. There are plenty to choose from on each of the three islands, most
        with pre-set specializations. Which two to take is up to the player''s discretion,
        how they''ve chosen to build Zak and their own play-style.<\/p>","expected_release_day":null,"expected_release_month":null,"expected_release_quarter":null,"expected_release_year":null,"id":17437,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/1\/14247\/1761921-evilislands_f_pcboxboxart_160w.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/14247\/1761921-evilislands_f_pcboxboxart_160w.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/1\/14247\/1761921-evilislands_f_pcboxboxart_160w.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/14247\/1761921-evilislands_f_pcboxboxart_160w.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/1\/14247\/1761921-evilislands_f_pcboxboxart_160w.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/1\/14247\/1761921-evilislands_f_pcboxboxart_160w.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/1\/14247\/1761921-evilislands_f_pcboxboxart_160w.jpg"},"name":"Evil

        data-ref-id=\"3010-2088\">Troika<\/a>''s second release The Temple of Elemental
        Evil (ToEE) is a party-based RPG that uses a modified DnD core 3.5 ruleset
        and allows characters to reach level 10. The game is notable for taking place
        in the original Greyhawk universe and not the <a href=\"\/the-forgotten-realms\/3035-29\"
        data-ref-id=\"3035-29\">Forgotten Realms<\/a>, which was the backdrop for
        almost all DnD CRPGs of that era. Another key difference of ToEE from its
        peers is that the game features a true turn-based system in lieu of the real-time,
        pause-to-command combat popularized by BioWare''s <a href=\"\/infinity-engine\/3015-495\"
        data-ref-id=\"3015-495\">Infinity-Engine<\/a> and <a href=\"\/aurora-engine\/3015-1468\"
        data-ref-id=\"3015-1468\">Aurora Engine<\/a> based games. Essentially players
        can move about a mixed 2D\/3D tileset in real-time during non-combat action
        and then seamlessly switch to an action-based \/ initiative system once they
        encounter foes. The turn-based combat allowed heroes and monsters alike to
        move in order based upon their initiative rolls and make attacks based on
        the standard action and move action system described by the D&amp;D 3.5 edition
        ruleset. Each turn required you to use a radial UI dial that allowed you to
        choose from the dozens of attack and defend movements as well the character''s
        large spell selection. The later battles required deep strategy with the player
        managing positioning, stances, counterspells and attacks.<\/p><p>The game,
        reviled and loved alike for its high difficulty, is often cited as the last
        of a dying genre that gave way to more action oriented RPG fare like Oblivion,
        Fallout 3, KOTOR and Mass Effect. In that sense ToEE remains a lasting example
        of how to reproduce complicated pen and paper style gameplay on a monitor.
        Others however criticize the game for its overly involved number crunching
        and slow paced combat. The latter, more popular view, combined with a fairly
        unstable (some say rushed) release build caused the game to sell poorly. Troika,
        which is fittingly a Russian word meaning \"three of something\", would go
        on to release only one more game -- its third -- <a href=\"\/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines\/3030-16426\"
        data-ref-id=\"3030-16426\">Vampire: Masquerade<\/a>.<\/p><p>Similarly to Vampire,
        the game received numerous fan made patches. Patches which, in some cases,
        also restored cut content, a brothel, removed due to fear of censorship in
        some territories. The Circle of Eight community has made the game bug free,
        increased the level cap to 20, added spells, and a lot of high end content.
